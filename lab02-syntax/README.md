### ***1.1 - Comment***

Rust support a few different varieties: 

* Regular comment with are ignored by the compiler:

```rust
// line comments which go to the end of the line.
/* block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */
```

* Doc comments which are parsed into HTML library documentation (at 24. Meta -> 24.1  Document): 

```rust
/// generate library docs for the following item. 
//! generate library docs for the enclosing item.
```

### ***1.2 - Formatted print***

Printing is handled by a series of macro defined std::fmt some of which include:

* ***format!*** - write formatted text to String
* ***print!*** - same as *format!* but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout)
* ***println!*** - same as *print!* but a newline is appended.
* ***eprint!*** - same as *print!* but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr). 
* ***eprintln!*** - same as *eprint!* but a newline appended.

```rust
fn main() {
    // In general, the `{}` will be automatically replaced with any
    // arguments. These will be stringified.
    println!("{} days", 31);

    // Positional arguments can be used. Specifying an integer inside `{}`
    // determines which additional argument will be replaced. Arguments start
    // at 0 immediately after the format string
    println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");

    // As can named arguments.
    println!("{subject} {verb} {object}",
             object="the lazy dog",
             subject="the quick brown fox",
             verb="jumps over");

    // Different formatting can be invoked by specifying the format character after a
    // `:`.
    println!("Base 10:               {}",   69420); //69420
    println!("Base 2 (binary):       {:b}", 69420); //10000111100101100
    println!("Base 8 (octal):        {:o}", 69420); //207454
    println!("Base 16 (hexadecimal): {:x}", 69420); //10f2c
    println!("Base 16 (hexadecimal): {:X}", 69420); //10F2C


    // You can right-justify text with a specified width. This will
    // output "    1". (Four white spaces and a "1", for a total width of 5.)
    println!("{number:>5}", number=1);

    // You can pad numbers with extra zeroes,
    //and left-adjust by flipping the sign. This will output "10000".
    println!("{number:0<5}", number=1);

    // You can use named arguments in the format specifier by appending a `$`
    println!("{number:0>width$}", number=1, width=5);


    // Rust even checks to make sure the correct number of arguments are
    // used.
    println!("My name is {0}, {1} {0}", "Bond");
    // FIXME ^ Add the missing argument: "James"

    // Only types that implement fmt::Display can be formatted with `{}`. User-
    // defined types do not implement fmt::Display by default

    #[allow(dead_code)]
    struct Structure(i32);

    // This will not compile because `Structure` does not implement
    // fmt::Display
    //println!("This struct `{}` won't print...", Structure(3));
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // For Rust 1.58 and above, you can directly capture the argument from a
    // surrounding variable. Just like the above, this will output
    // "     1". 5 white spaces and a "1".
    let number: f64 = 1.0;
    let width: usize = 5;
    println!("{number:>width$}");
}
```
#### ***1.2.1 - Debug***

Using ```{:?}``` to debug

```rust
// Derive the `fmt::Debug` implementation for `Structure`. `Structure`
// is a structure which contains a single `i32`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Structure(i32);

// Put a `Structure` inside of the structure `Deep`. Make it printable
// also.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Deep(Structure);

fn main() {
    // Printing with `{:?}` is similar to with `{}`.
    println!("{:?} months in a year.", 12);
    println!("{1:?} {0:?} is the {actor:?} name.",
             "Slater",
             "Christian",
             actor="actor's");

    // `Structure` is printable!
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Structure(3));
    
    // The problem with `derive` is there is no control over how
    // the results look. What if I want this to just show a `7`?
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Deep(Structure(7)));
}
```

Pretty printing with ***{:#?}***

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    age: u8
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Peter";
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Pretty print
    println!("{:#?}", peter);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo02.rs](./src/demo02.rs)

#### ***1.2.2 - Display***

```fmt::Debug``` hardly look compact and clean, so it is often advantageous to customize the output appearance. This is done by manually implementing ```fmt::Display```, which uses the ```{}``` print marker. Implement it look like this: 

```rust
// Import (via `use`) the `fmt` module to make it available.
use std::fmt;

// Define a structure for which `fmt::Display` will be implemented. This is
// a tuple struct named `Structure` that contains an `i32`.
struct Structure(i32);

// To use the `{}` marker, the trait `fmt::Display` must be implemented
// manually for the type.
impl fmt::Display for Structure {
    // This trait requires `fmt` with this exact signature.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Write strictly the first element into the supplied output
        // stream: `f`. Returns `fmt::Result` which indicates whether the
        // operation succeeded or failed. Note that `write!` uses syntax which
        // is very similar to `println!`.
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}
```

```fmt::Display``` may be cleaner than ```fmt::Debug``` but this presents a problem for the std library. How should ambiguous types be displayed? For example, if the std library implemented a single style for all ```Vec<T>```, what style should it be? Would it be either of these two?

* ```Vec<path>```: ```/:/etc/home/username:/bin``` (split on ```:```)
* ```Vec<number>```: ```1, 2, 3``` (split on ```,```)

No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the ```std``` library doesn't presume to dictate one. ```fmt::Display``` is not implemented for ```Vec<T>``` or for any other generic containers. ```fmt::Debug``` must then be used for these for generic cases.

This is not a problem though because for any new container type which is not generic, ```fmt::Display``` can be implemented.

```rust
use std::fmt; // Import `fmt`

// A structure holding two numbers. `Debug` will be derived so the results can
// be contrasted with `Display`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MinMax(i64, i64);

// Implement `Display` for `MinMax`.
impl fmt::Display for MinMax {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Use `self.number` to refer to each positional data point.
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.0, self.1)
    }
}

// Define a structure where the fields are nameable for comparison.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point2D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Similarly, implement `Display` for `Point2D`
impl fmt::Display for Point2D {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Customize so only `x` and `y` are denoted.
        write!(f, "x: {}, y: {}", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let minmax = MinMax(0, 14);

    println!("Compare structures:");
    println!("Display: {}", minmax);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", minmax);

    let big_range =   MinMax(-300, 300);
    let small_range = MinMax(-3, 3);

    println!("The big range is {big} and the small is {small}",
             small = small_range,
             big = big_range);

    let point = Point2D { x: 3.3, y: 7.2 };

    println!("Compare points:");
    println!("Display: {}", point);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", point);

    // Error. Both `Debug` and `Display` were implemented, but `{:b}`
    // requires `fmt::Binary` to be implemented. This will not work.
    // println!("What does Point2D look like in binary: {:b}?", point);
}
```

So, ```fmt::Display``` has been implemented but ```fmt::Binary``` has not, and therefore cannot be used. ```std::fmt``` has many such ```traits``` and each requires its own implementation. This is detailed further in ```std::fmt```.

**Activity**

After checking the output of the above example, use the ```Point2D``` struct as a guide to add a ```Complex``` struct to the example. When printed in the same way, the output should be:

```shell
Display: 3.3 + 7.2i
Debug: Complex { real: 3.3, image: 7.2 }
```

**Testcase: List**

Implementing ```fmt::Display``` for a structure where the elements must each be handled sequentially is tricky. The problem is that each ```write!``` generates a ```fmt::Result```. Proper handling of this requires dealing with *all* the results. Rust provides the ```?``` operator for exactly this purpose.

Using ```?``` on ```write!``` looks like this:

```rust
// Try `write!` to see if it errors.
// If it errors, return the error. Otherwise continue
write!(f, "{}", value)?;
```

With ```?``` available, implementing ```fmt::Display``` for a ```Vec``` is straightforward:

```rust
use std::fmt; // Import the `fmt` module.

// Define a structure named `List` containing a `Vec`.
struct List(Vec<i32>);

impl fmt::Display for List {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Extract the value using tuple indexing,
        // and create a reference to `vec`.
        let vec = &self.0;

        write!(f, "[")?;

        // Iterate over `v` in `vec` while enumerating the iteration
        // count in `count`.
        for (count, v) in vec.iter().enumerate() {
            // For every element except the first, add a comma.
            // Use the ? operator to return on errors.
            if count != 0 { write!(f, ", ")?; }
            write!(f, "{}", v)?;
        }

        // Close the opened bracket and return a fmt::Result value.
        write!(f, "]");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let v = List(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    println!("{}", v);
}
```

**Activity**

Try changing the program so that the index of each element in the vector is also printed. The new output should look like this:

```rust
[0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3]
```

#### ***1.2.3 - Formatting***

We've seen that formatting is specified via a *format string*:

* ```format!("{}", foo) -> "3735928559"```
* ```format!(0x{:X}, foo) -> "0xDEADBEEF"```
* ```format!(0o{:o}, foo) -> "0o33653337357"```

The same variable (```foo```) can be formatted differently depending on which *argument type* is used: ```x``` vs ```o``` vs ```unspecified```.

This formatting functionally is implemented via trails, and there is one trait for each argument type. The most common formatting trait is ```Display```, which handles cases where the argument type is left unspecified ```{}``` for instance.

```rust
use std::fmt::{self, Formatter, Display};

struct City {
    name: &'static str,
    // Latitude
    lat: f32,
    // Longitude
    lon: f32,
}

impl Display for City {
    // `f` is a buffer, and this method must write the formatted string into it
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        let lat_c = if self.lat >= 0.0 { 'N' } else { 'S' };
        let lon_c = if self.lon >= 0.0 { 'E' } else { 'W' };

        // `write!` is like `format!`, but it will write the formatted string
        // into a buffer (the first argument)
        write!(f, "{}: {:.3}°{} {:.3}°{}",
               self.name, self.lat.abs(), lat_c, self.lon.abs(), lon_c)
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Color {
    red: u8,
    green: u8,
    blue: u8,
}

fn main() {
    for city in [
        City { name: "Dublin", lat: 53.347778, lon: -6.259722 },
        City { name: "Oslo", lat: 59.95, lon: 10.75 },
        City { name: "Vancouver", lat: 49.25, lon: -123.1 },
    ].iter() {
        println!("{}", *city);
    }
    for color in [
        Color { red: 128, green: 255, blue: 90 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 3, blue: 254 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0 },
    ].iter() {
        // Switch this to use {} once you've added an implementation
        // for fmt::Display.
        println!("{:?}", *color);
    }
}
```

**Activity**

Add an implementation of the ```fmt::Display``` trait for the ```Color``` struct above so that the output displays as: 

```shell
RGB (128, 255, 90) 0x80FF5A
RGB (0, 3, 254) 0x0003FE
RGB (0, 0, 0) 0x000000
```

Reference [./src/demo03.rs](./src/demo03.rs)

## **2 - Primitives**

Rust provides access to a wide variety of ```primitives```. A sample includes:

**Scalar types**

* Signed integers: ```i8```, ```i16```, ```i32```, ```i64```, ```i128``` and ```isize``` (pointer size)
* Unsigned integer: ```u8```, ```u16```, ```u32```, ```u64```, ````u128```` and ```usize``` (pointer size)
* Floating point: ```f32```, ```f64```
* ```char``` Unicode scalar values like ```'a'```, ```'⍺'```, ```'∞'``` (4 bytes each)
* ```bool``` either ```true``` or ```false```
* and the unit type ```()```, whose only possible value is an empty tuple: ```()```

Despite the value of a unit type being a tuple, it is not considered a compound type because it does not contain multiple values.

**Compound Types**

* arrays like ```[1, 2, 3]```
* tuples like ```(1, true)```

Variables can always be *type annotated*. Numbers may additionally be annotated via a *suffix or by default*.

Integer default to ```i32``` and floats to ```f64```.

Note that Rust can also infer types from context.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Variables can be type annotated.
    let logical: bool = true;

    let a_float: f64 = 1.0;  // Regular annotation
    let an_integer   = 5i32; // Suffix annotation

    // Or a default will be used.
    let default_float   = 3.0; // `f64`
    let default_integer = 7;   // `i32`
    
    // A type can also be inferred from context 
    let mut inferred_type = 12; // Type i64 is inferred from another line
    inferred_type = 4294967296i64;
    
    // A mutable variable's value can be changed.
    let mut mutable = 12; // Mutable `i32`
    mutable = 21;
    
    // Error! The type of a variable can't be changed.
    mutable = true;
    
    // Variables can be overwritten with shadowing.
    let mutable = true;
}
```

Reference [./src/demo04.rs](./src/demo04.rs)

### ***2.1 - Literals and Operator***

Integer ```1```, floats ```1.2```, characters ```'a'```, string ```"abc"```, booleans ```true``` and the unit type ```()``` can be expressed using literals. 

Integers can, alternatively, be expressed hexadecimal, octal or binary notation using these prefixes respectively: ```0x```, ```0o``` or ```0b```.

Underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability, e.g. ```1_0000``` is the same as ```1000```, and ```0.000_001``` is the same as ```0.000001```.

We need to tell the compiler the type of the literals we use. For now, we'll use the ```u32``` suffix to indicate that the literal is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and the ```i32``` suffix to indicate that it's signed 32-bit integer.

The operators available and their precedence in Rust are similar to other C-like languages.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Integer addition
    println!("1 + 2 = {}", 1u32 + 2);

    // Integer subtraction
    println!("1 - 2 = {}", 1i32 - 2);
    // TODO ^ Try changing `1i32` to `1u32` to see why the type is important

    // Short-circuiting boolean logic
    println!("true AND false is {}", true && false);
    println!("true OR false is {}", true || false);
    println!("NOT true is {}", !true);

    // Bitwise operations
    println!("0011 AND 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 & 0b0101);
    println!("0011 OR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 | 0b0101);
    println!("0011 XOR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 ^ 0b0101);
    println!("1 << 5 is {}", 1u32 << 5);
    println!("0x80 >> 2 is 0x{:x}", 0x80u32 >> 2);

    // Use underscores to improve readability!
    println!("One million is written as {}", 1_000_000u32);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo05.rs](./src/demo05.rs)

### ***2.2 - Tuples***

A tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples are constructed using parentheses ```()```, and each tuple itself is a value with type signature ```(T1, T2, ...)```, where ```T1```, ```T2``` are the types of its members. Functions can use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values.

```rust
// Tuples can be used as function arguments and as return values
fn reverse(pair: (i32, bool)) -> (bool, i32) {
    // `let` can be used to bind the members of a tuple to variables
    let (int_param, bool_param) = pair;

    (bool_param, int_param)
}

// The following struct is for the activity.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Matrix(f32, f32, f32, f32);

fn main() {
    // A tuple with a bunch of different types
    let long_tuple = (1u8, 2u16, 3u32, 4u64,
                      -1i8, -2i16, -3i32, -4i64,
                      0.1f32, 0.2f64,
                      'a', true);

    // Values can be extracted from the tuple using tuple indexing
    println!("long tuple first value: {}", long_tuple.0);
    println!("long tuple second value: {}", long_tuple.1);

    // Tuples can be tuple members
    let tuple_of_tuples = ((1u8, 2u16, 2u32), (4u64, -1i8), -2i16);

    // Tuples are printable
    println!("tuple of tuples: {:?}", tuple_of_tuples);
    
    // But long Tuples (more than 12 elements) cannot be printed
    // let too_long_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13);
    // println!("too long tuple: {:?}", too_long_tuple);
    // TODO ^ Uncomment the above 2 lines to see the compiler error

    let pair = (1, true);
    println!("pair is {:?}", pair);

    println!("the reversed pair is {:?}", reverse(pair));

    // To create one element tuples, the comma is required to tell them apart
    // from a literal surrounded by parentheses
    println!("one element tuple: {:?}", (5u32,));
    println!("just an integer: {:?}", (5u32));

    //tuples can be destructured to create bindings
    let tuple = (1, "hello", 4.5, true);

    let (a, b, c, d) = tuple;
    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}, {:?}", a, b, c, d);

    let matrix = Matrix(1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2);
    println!("{:?}", matrix);

}
```

Reference [./src/demo06.rs](./src/demo06.rs)

**Activity**

1. *Recap*: Add the ```fmt::Display``` trait the ```Matrix``` struct in the above example, so that if you switch from printing the debug format ```{:?}``` to the display format ```{}```, you see the following output:

```shell
( 1.1, 1.2 )
( 2.1, 2.2 )
```

2. Add ```transpose``` function using the ```reverse``` function as a template, which accepts a matrix as an argument, and returns a matrix in which two elements have been swapped. For example:

```rust
println!("Matrix:\n{}", matrix);
println!("Transpose:\n{}", transpose(matrix));
```

results in the output: 

```shell
Matrix:
( 1.1, 1.2 )
( 2.1, 2.2 )
Transpose:
( 1.1, 2.1 )
( 1.2, 2.2 )
```

### ***2.3 - Arrays and Slices***

An array is a collection of objects of the same type ```T```, stored in contiguous memory. Arrays are created using brackets ```[]```, and their length. which is know at compile time, is part of their type signature ```[T; length]```.

Slices are similar to arrays, but their length is not known at compile time. Instead, a slice is a two-word object, the first word is a pointer to the data, and the second word is the length of the slice. The word size is the same as usize, determined by the processor architecture e.g. 65-bits on an x86-64. Slices can be used to borrow a section of an array, and have the type signature ```&[T]```.

```rust
use std::mem;

// This function borrows a slice
fn analyze_slice(slice: &[i32]) {
    println!("first element of the slice: {}", slice[0]);
    println!("the slice has {} elements", slice.len());
}

fn main() {
    // Fixed-size array (type signature is superfluous)
    let xs: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // All elements can be initialized to the same value
    let ys: [i32; 500] = [0; 500];

    // Indexing starts at 0
    println!("first element of the array: {}", xs[0]);
    println!("second element of the array: {}", xs[1]);

    // `len` returns the count of elements in the array
    println!("number of elements in array: {}", xs.len());

    // Arrays are stack allocated
    println!("array occupies {} bytes", mem::size_of_val(&xs));

    // Arrays can be automatically borrowed as slices
    println!("borrow the whole array as a slice");
    analyze_slice(&xs);

    // Slices can point to a section of an array
    // They are of the form [starting_index..ending_index]
    // starting_index is the first position in the slice
    // ending_index is one more than the last position in the slice
    println!("borrow a section of the array as a slice");
    analyze_slice(&ys[1 .. 4]);

    // Example of empty slice `&[]`
    let empty_array: [u32; 0] = [];
    assert_eq!(&empty_array, &[]);
    assert_eq!(&empty_array, &[][..]); // same but more verbose

    // Arrays can be safely accessed using `.get`, which returns an
    // `Option`. This can be matched as shown below, or used with
    // `.expect()` if you would like the program to exit with a nice
    // message instead of happily continue.
    for i in 0..xs.len() + 1 { // OOPS, one element too far
        match xs.get(i) {
            Some(xval) => println!("{}: {}", i, xval),
            None => println!("Slow down! {} is too far!", i),
        }
    }

    // Out of bound indexing causes compile error

## **3 - Custom Types**

Rust custom data types are formed mainly through the two keywords: 

* ```struct```: define a structure
* ```enum```: define an enumeration

Constants can also be created via the ```const``` and ```static``` keywords.

### ***3.1 - Structures***

There are three types of structures ("structs") that can be created using the ```struct``` keyword:

* Tuple structs, which are, basically, named tuples. 
* The classic C-structs
* Unit structs, which are field-less, are useful for generics.

```rust
// An attribute to hide warnings for unused code.
#![allow(dead_code)]

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

// A unit struct
struct Unit;

// A tuple struct
struct Pair(i32, f32);

// A struct with two fields
struct Point {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

// Structs can be reused as fields of another struct
struct Rectangle {
    // A rectangle can be specified by where the top left and bottom right
    // corners are in space.
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

fn main() {
    // Create struct with field init shorthand
    let name = String::from("Peter");
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Print debug struct
    println!("{:?}", peter);

    // Instantiate a `Point`
    let point: Point = Point { x: 10.3, y: 0.4 };

    // Access the fields of the point
    println!("point coordinates: ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);

    // Make a new point by using struct update syntax to use the fields of our
    // other one
    let bottom_right = Point { x: 5.2, ..point };

    // `bottom_right.y` will be the same as `point.y` because we used that field
    // from `point`
    println!("second point: ({}, {})", bottom_right.x, bottom_right.y);

    // Destructure the point using a `let` binding
    let Point { x: left_edge, y: top_edge } = point;

    let _rectangle = Rectangle {
        // struct instantiation is an expression too
        top_left: Point { x: left_edge, y: top_edge },
        bottom_right: bottom_right,
    };

    // Instantiate a unit struct
    let _unit = Unit;

    // Instantiate a tuple struct
    let pair = Pair(1, 0.1);

    // Access the fields of a tuple struct
    println!("pair contains {:?} and {:?}", pair.0, pair.1);

    // Destructure a tuple struct
    let Pair(integer, decimal) = pair;

    println!("pair contains {:?} and {:?}", integer, decimal);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo08.rs](./src/demo08.rs)

**Activity**

1. Add a function ```rect_area``` which calculates the area of a ```Rectangle``` (try using nested destructing). 
2. Add a function ```square``` which takes a ```Point``` and a ```f32``` as arguments, and returns a ```Rectangle``` with its top left corner on the point, and a width and height corresponding to the ```f32```.

### ***3.2 - Enums***

The ```enum``` keyword allows the creation of a type which may be one of a few different variants. Any variant which is valid as as ```struct``` is also valid as an ```enum```.

```rust
// Create an `enum` to classify a web event. Note how both
// names and type information together specify the variant:
// `PageLoad != PageUnload` and `KeyPress(char) != Paste(String)`.
// Each is different and independent.
enum WebEvent {
    // An `enum` may either be `unit-like`,
    PageLoad,
    PageUnload,
    // like tuple structs,
    KeyPress(char),
    Paste(String),
    // or c-like structures.
    Click { x: i64, y: i64 },
}

// A function which takes a `WebEvent` enum as an argument and
// returns nothing.
fn inspect(event: WebEvent) {
    match event {
        WebEvent::PageLoad => println!("page loaded"),
        WebEvent::PageUnload => println!("page unloaded"),
        // Destructure `c` from inside the `enum`.
        WebEvent::KeyPress(c) => println!("pressed '{}'.", c),
        WebEvent::Paste(s) => println!("pasted \"{}\".", s),
        // Destructure `Click` into `x` and `y`.
        WebEvent::Click { x, y } => {
            println!("clicked at x={}, y={}.", x, y);
        },
    }
}

fn main() {
    let pressed = WebEvent::KeyPress('x');
    // `to_owned()` creates an owned `String` from a string slice.
    let pasted  = WebEvent::Paste("my text".to_owned());
    let click   = WebEvent::Click { x: 20, y: 80 };
    let load    = WebEvent::PageLoad;
    let unload  = WebEvent::PageUnload;

    inspect(pressed);
    inspect(pasted);
    inspect(click);
    inspect(load);
    inspect(unload);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo09.rs](./src/demo09.rs)

**Type aliases** 

If you use a type alias, you can refer to each enum variant via its alias. This might be useful if the enum's name is too long or too generic, and you want to rename it.

```rust
enum VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers {
    Add,
    Subtract,
}

// Creates a type alias
type Operations = VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers;

fn main() {
    // We can refer to each variant via its alias, not its long and inconvenient
    // name.
    let x = Operations::Add;
}
```

The most common place you'll see this is ```impl``` blocks using the ```Self``` alias.

```rust
enum VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers {
    Add,
    Subtract,
}

impl VeryVerboseEnumOfThingsToDoWithNumbers {
    fn run(&self, x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
        match self {
            Self::Add => x + y,
            Self::Subtract => x - y,
        }
    }
}
```

#### ***3.2.1 - use***

The ```use``` declaration can be used so manual scoping isn't needed

```rust
// An attribute to hide warnings for unused code.
#![allow(dead_code)]

enum Status {
    Rich,
    Poor,
}

enum Work {
    Civilian,
    Soldier,
}

fn main() {
    // Explicitly `use` each name so they are available without
    // manual scoping.
    use crate::Status::{Poor, Rich};
    // Automatically `use` each name inside `Work`.
    use crate::Work::*;

    // Equivalent to `Status::Poor`.
    let status = Poor;
    // Equivalent to `Work::Civilian`.
    let work = Civilian;

    match status {
        // Note the lack of scoping because of the explicit `use` above.
        Rich => println!("The rich have lots of money!"),
        Poor => println!("The poor have no money..."),
    }

    match work {
        // Note again the lack of scoping.
        Civilian => println!("Civilians work!"),
        Soldier  => println!("Soldiers fight!"),
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo10.rs](./src/demo10.rs)

#### ***3.2.2 - C-like***

```enum``` can also be used as C-like enums

```rust
// An attribute to hide warnings for unused code.
#![allow(dead_code)]

// enum with implicit discriminator (starts at 0)
enum Number {
    Zero,
    One,
    Two,
}

// enum with explicit discriminator
enum Color {
    Red = 0xff0000,
    Green = 0x00ff00,
    Blue = 0x0000ff,
}

fn main() {
    // `enums` can be cast as integers.
    println!("zero is {}", Number::Zero as i32);
    println!("one is {}", Number::One as i32);

    println!("roses are #{:06x}", Color::Red as i32);
    println!("violets are #{:06x}", Color::Blue as i32);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo11.rs](./src/demo11.rs)

#### ***3.2.3 - Testcase: linked-list***

A common way to implement a linked-list is via ```enum```

```rust
use crate::List::*;

enum List {
    // Cons: Tuple struct that wraps an element and a pointer to the next node
    Cons(u32, Box<List>),
    // Nil: A node that signifies the end of the linked list
    Nil,
}

// Methods can be attached to an enum
impl List {
    // Create an empty list
    fn new() -> List {
        // `Nil` has type `List`
        Nil
    }

    // Consume a list, and return the same list with a new element at its front
    fn prepend(self, elem: u32) -> List {
        // `Cons` also has type List
        Cons(elem, Box::new(self))
    }

    // Return the length of the list
    fn len(&self) -> u32 {
        // `self` has to be matched, because the behavior of this method
        // depends on the variant of `self`
        // `self` has type `&List`, and `*self` has type `List`, matching on a
        // concrete type `T` is preferred over a match on a reference `&T`
        // after Rust 2018 you can use self here and tail (with no ref) below as well,
        // rust will infer &s and ref tail. 
        // See https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2018/ownership-and-lifetimes/default-match-bindings.html
        match *self {
            // Can't take ownership of the tail, because `self` is borrowed;
            // instead take a reference to the tail
            Cons(_, ref tail) => 1 + tail.len(),
            // Base Case: An empty list has zero length
            Nil => 0
        }
    }

    // Return representation of the list as a (heap allocated) string
    fn stringify(&self) -> String {
        match *self {
            Cons(head, ref tail) => {
                // `format!` is similar to `print!`, but returns a heap
                // allocated string instead of printing to the console
                format!("{}, {}", head, tail.stringify())
            },
            Nil => {
                format!("Nil")
            },
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Create an empty linked list
    let mut list = List::new();

    // Prepend some elements
    list = list.prepend(1);
    list = list.prepend(2);
    list = list.prepend(3);

    // Show the final state of the list
    println!("linked list has length: {}", list.len());
    println!("{}", list.stringify());
}
```

Reference [./src/demo12.rs](./src/demo12.rs)

### ***3.3 - Constants***

Rust has two different types of constants which can be declared in any scope including global. Both require explicit type annotation: 

* ```const```: An unchangeable value (the common case). 
* ```static```: A possibly ```mut``` able variable with ```'static``` lifetime. The static lifetime is inferred and does not have to be specified. Accessing or modifying a mutable static variable is ```unsafe```.

```rust
// Globals are declared outside all other scopes.
static LANGUAGE: &str = "Rust";
const THRESHOLD: i32 = 10;

fn is_big(n: i32) -> bool {
    // Access constant in some function
    n > THRESHOLD
}

fn main() {
    let n = 16;

    // Access constant in the main thread
    println!("This is {}", LANGUAGE);
    println!("The threshold is {}", THRESHOLD);
    println!("{} is {}", n, if is_big(n) { "big" } else { "small" });

    // Error! Cannot modify a `const`.
    // THRESHOLD = 5;
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line
}
```

Reference [./src/demo13.rs](./src/demo13.rs)

## **4 - Variable Bindings**

Rust provides type safety via static typing. Variable bindings can be type annotated when declared. However, in most cases, the compiler will be able to infer the type of the variable from the context, heavily reducing the annotation burden.

Values (like literals) can be bound to variables, using the ```let``` binding.

```rust
fn main() {
    let an_integer = 1u32;
    let a_boolean = true;
    let unit = ();

    // copy `an_integer` into `copied_integer`
    let copied_integer = an_integer;

    println!("An integer: {:?}", copied_integer);
    println!("A boolean: {:?}", a_boolean);
    println!("Meet the unit value: {:?}", unit);

    // The compiler warns about unused variable bindings; these warnings can
    // be silenced by prefixing the variable name with an underscore
    let _unused_variable = 3u32;

    let noisy_unused_variable = 2u32;
    // FIXME ^ Prefix with an underscore to suppress the warning
    // Please note that warnings may not be shown in a browser
}
```

Reference [./src/demo14.rs](./src/demo14.rs)

### ***4.1 - Mutability***

Variable bindings are immutable by default, but this can be overridden using the ```mut``` modifier.

```rust
fn main() {
    let _immutable_binding = 1;
    let mut mutable_binding = 1;

    println!("Before mutation: {}", mutable_binding);

    // Ok
    mutable_binding += 1;

    println!("After mutation: {}", mutable_binding);

    // Error!
    _immutable_binding += 1;
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line
}
```

Reference [./src/demo15.rs](./src/demo15.rs)

### ***4.2 - Scope and Shadowing***

Variable bindings have a scope, and are constrained to live in a *block*. A block is a collection of statements enclosed by braces ```{}```.

```rust
fn main() {
    // This binding lives in the main function
    let long_lived_binding = 1;

    // This is a block, and has a smaller scope than the main function
    {
        // This binding only exists in this block
        let short_lived_binding = 2;

        println!("inner short: {}", short_lived_binding);
    }
    // End of the block

    // Error! `short_lived_binding` doesn't exist in this scope
    println!("outer short: {}", short_lived_binding);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    println!("outer long: {}", long_lived_binding);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo16.rs](./src/demo16.rs)

Also, variable shadowing is allowed

```rust
fn main() {
    let shadowed_binding = 1;

    {
        println!("before being shadowed: {}", shadowed_binding);

        // This binding *shadows* the outer one
        let shadowed_binding = "abc";

        println!("shadowed in inner block: {}", shadowed_binding);
    }
    println!("outside inner block: {}", shadowed_binding);

    // This binding *shadows* the previous binding
    let shadowed_binding = 2;
    println!("shadowed in outer block: {}", shadowed_binding);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo17.rs](./src/demo17.rs)

### ***4.3 - Declare first***

It's possible to declare variable bindings first, and initialize them later. However, this form is seldom used, as it may lead to the use of uninitialized variables.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Declare a variable binding
    let a_binding;

    {
        let x = 2;

        // Initialize the binding
        a_binding = x * x;
    }

    println!("a binding: {}", a_binding);

    let another_binding;

    // Error! Use of uninitialized binding
    println!("another binding: {}", another_binding);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    another_binding = 1;

    println!("another binding: {}", another_binding);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo18.rs](./src/demo18.rs)

### ***4.4 - Freezing***

When data is bound by the same name immutably, it also freezes. Frozen data can't be modified until the immutable binding goes out of scope:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut _mutable_integer = 7i32;

    {
        // Shadowing by immutable `_mutable_integer`
        let _mutable_integer = _mutable_integer;

        // Error! `_mutable_integer` is frozen in this scope
        _mutable_integer = 50;
        // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

        // `_mutable_integer` goes out of scope
    }

    // Ok! `_mutable_integer` is not frozen in this scope
    _mutable_integer = 3;
}
```

Reference [./src/demo19.rs](./src/demo19.rs)

## **5 - Types**

Rust provides several mechanisms to change or define the type of primitive and user defined types.

The following sections cover: 

* ```Casting``` between primitive types 
* Specifying the desired type of ```literals``` 
* Using ```type inference```
* ```Aliasing``` types

### ***5.1 - Casting***

Rust provides no implicit type conversion (coercion) between primitive types. But, explicit type conversion (casting) can be performed using the ```as``` keyword.

Rules for converting between integral types follow C conventions generally, except in cases where C has undefined behavior. The behavior of all casts between integral types is well defined in Rust.

```rust
// Suppress all warnings from casts which overflow.
#![allow(overflowing_literals)]

fn main() {
    let decimal = 65.4321_f32;

    // Error! No implicit conversion
    let integer: u8 = decimal;
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    // Explicit conversion
    let integer = decimal as u8;
    let character = integer as char;

    // Error! There are limitations in conversion rules. 
    // A float cannot be directly converted to a char.
    let character = decimal as char;
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line

    println!("Casting: {} -> {} -> {}", decimal, integer, character);

    // when casting any value to an unsigned type, T,
    // T::MAX + 1 is added or subtracted until the value
    // fits into the new type

    // 1000 already fits in a u16
    println!("1000 as a u16 is: {}", 1000 as u16);

    // 1000 - 256 - 256 - 256 = 232
    // Under the hood, the first 8 least significant bits (LSB) are kept,
    // while the rest towards the most significant bit (MSB) get truncated.
    println!("1000 as a u8 is : {}", 1000 as u8);
    // -1 + 256 = 255
    println!("  -1 as a u8 is : {}", (-1i8) as u8);

    // For positive numbers, this is the same as the modulus
    println!("1000 mod 256 is : {}", 1000 % 256);

    // When casting to a signed type, the (bitwise) result is the same as
    // first casting to the corresponding unsigned type. If the most significant
    // bit of that value is 1, then the value is negative.

    // Unless it already fits, of course.
    println!(" 128 as a i16 is: {}", 128 as i16);
    
    // 128 as i8 -> -128, whose two's complement in eight bits is:
    println!(" 128 as a i8 is : {}", 128 as i8);

    // repeating the example above
    // 1000 as u8 -> 232
    println!("1000 as a u8 is : {}", 1000 as u8);
    // and the two's complement of 232 is -24
    println!(" 232 as a i8 is : {}", 232 as i8);
    
    // Since Rust 1.45, the `as` keyword performs a *saturating cast* 
    // when casting from float to int. If the floating point value exceeds 
    // the upper bound or is less than the lower bound, the returned value 
    // will be equal to the bound crossed.
    
    // 300.0 is 255
    println!("300.0 is {}", 300.0_f32 as u8);
    // -100.0 as u8 is 0
    println!("-100.0 as u8 is {}", -100.0_f32 as u8);
    // nan as u8 is 0
    println!("nan as u8 is {}", f32::NAN as u8);
    
    // This behavior incurs a small runtime cost and can be avoided 
    // with unsafe methods, however the results might overflow and 
    // return **unsound values**. Use these methods wisely:
    unsafe {
        // 300.0 is 44
        println!("300.0 is {}", 300.0_f32.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
        // -100.0 as u8 is 156
        println!("-100.0 as u8 is {}", (-100.0_f32).to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
        // nan as u8 is 0
        println!("nan as u8 is {}", f32::NAN.to_int_unchecked::<u8>());
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo20.rs](./src/demo20.rs)
### ***5.2 - Literals***

Numeric literals can be type annotated by adding the type as a suffix. As an example, to specify that the literal ```42``` should have the type ```i32```, write ```42i32```.

The type of unsuffixed numeric literals will depend on how they are used. If no constraint exists, the compiler will use ```i32``` for integer, and ```f64``` for floating-point numbers.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Suffixed literals, their types are known at initialization
    let x = 1u8;
    let y = 2u32;
    let z = 3f32;

    // Unsuffixed literals, their types depend on how they are used
    let i = 1;
    let f = 1.0;

    // `size_of_val` returns the size of a variable in bytes
    println!("size of `x` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&x));
    println!("size of `y` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&y));
    println!("size of `z` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&z));
    println!("size of `i` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&i));
    println!("size of `f` in bytes: {}", std::mem::size_of_val(&f));
}
```

Reference [./src/demo21.rs](./src/demo21.rs)

There are some concepts used in the previous code that haven't been explained yet, here's a brief explanation for the impatient readers: 

* ```std::mem::size_of_val``` is a function, but called with its *full path*. Code can be split in logical units called *modules*. In this case, the ```size_of_val``` function is defined in the ```mem``` module, and the ```mem``` module is defined in the ```std``` crate. For more details, see modules and crates.

### ***5.3 - Inference***

The type inference engine is pretty smart. It does more than looking at the type of the value expression during an initialization. It also looks at how the variable is used afterwards to infer its type. Here's an advanced example of type inference.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Because of the annotation, the compiler knows that `elem` has type u8.
    let elem = 5u8;

    // Create an empty vector (a growable array).
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    // At this point the compiler doesn't know the exact type of `vec`, it
    // just knows that it's a vector of something (`Vec<_>`).

    // Insert `elem` in the vector.
    vec.push(elem);
    // Aha! Now the compiler knows that `vec` is a vector of `u8`s (`Vec<u8>`)
    // TODO ^ Try commenting out the `vec.push(elem)` line

    println!("{:?}", vec);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo22.rs](./src/demo22.rs)

No type annotation of variables was needed, the compiler is happy and so is the programmer!

### ***5.4 - Aliasing***

The ```type``` statement can be used to give a new name to an existing type. Types must have ```UpperCamelCase``` names, or the compiler will raise a warning. The exception to this rule are the primitive types: ```usize```, ```f32```, etc.

```rust
// `NanoSecond`, `Inch`, and `U64` are new names for `u64`.
type NanoSecond = u64;
type Inch = u64;
type U64 = u64;

fn main() {
    // `NanoSecond` = `Inch` = `U64` = `u64`.
    let nanoseconds: NanoSecond = 5 as U64;
    let inches: Inch = 2 as U64;

    // Note that type aliases *don't* provide any extra type safety, because
    // aliases are *not* new types
    println!("{} nanoseconds + {} inches = {} unit?",
             nanoseconds,
             inches,
             nanoseconds + inches);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo23.rs](./src/demo23.rs)

The main use of aliases is to reduce boilerplate; for example the ```IoResult<T>``` type is an alias for the ```Result<T, IoError>``` type.

## **6 - Conversion**

Primitive types can be converted to each other through ```casting```.

Rust addresses conversion between custom types (i.e., ```struct``` and ```enum```) by the use of ```traits```. The generic conversions will use the ```From``` and ```Into``` traits. 

However there are more specific ones for the more common cases, in particular when converting to and from ```String S```.

### ***6.1 - From and Into***

The ```From``` and ```Into``` traits are inherently linked, and this is actually part of its implementation. If you are able to convert type A from type B, then it should be easy to believe that we should be able to convert type B to type A.

**From**

The ```From``` trait allows for a type to define how to create itself from another type, hence providing a very simple mechanism for converting between several types. There are numerous implementations of this trait within the standard library for conversion of primitive and common types.

For example we can easily convert a ```str``` into a ```String```

```rust
let my_str = "hello";
let my_string = String::from(my_str);
```

We can do similar for defining a conversion for our own type.

```rust
use std::convert::From;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Number {
    value: i32,
}

impl From<i32> for Number {
    fn from(item: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: item }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let num = Number::from(30);
    println!("My number is {:?}", num);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo24.rs](./src/demo24.rs)

**Into** 

The ```Into``` trait is simply the reciprocal of the ```From``` trait. That is, if you have implemented the ```From``` trait for your type, ```Into``` will call it when necessary.

Using the ```Into``` trait will typically require specification of the type to convert into as the compiler is unable to determine this most of the time. However this is a small trade-off considering we get the functionality for free.

```rust
use std::convert::From;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Number {
    value: i32,
}

impl From<i32> for Number {
    fn from(item: i32) -> Self {
        Number { value: item }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let int = 5;
    // Try removing the type declaration
    let num: Number = int.into();
    println!("My number is {:?}", num);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo25.rs](./src/demo25.rs)

### ***6.2 - TryFrom and TryInto***

Similar to ```From``` and ```Into```, ```TryFrom``` and ```TryInto``` are generic traits for converting between types. Unlike ```From/Into```, the ```TryFrom/TryInto``` traits are used for fallible conversions, and as such, return ```Result S```.

```rust
use std::convert::TryFrom;
use std::convert::TryInto;

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq)]
struct EvenNumber(i32);

impl TryFrom<i32> for EvenNumber {
    type Error = ();

    fn try_from(value: i32) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        if value % 2 == 0 {
            Ok(EvenNumber(value))
        } else {
            Err(())
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // TryFrom

    assert_eq!(EvenNumber::try_from(8), Ok(EvenNumber(8)));
    assert_eq!(EvenNumber::try_from(5), Err(()));

    // TryInto

    let result: Result<EvenNumber, ()> = 8i32.try_into();
    assert_eq!(result, Ok(EvenNumber(8)));
    let result: Result<EvenNumber, ()> = 5i32.try_into();
    assert_eq!(result, Err(()));
}
```

Reference [./src/demo26.rs](./src/demo26.rs)

### ***6.3 - To and From Strings***

**Converting to String** 

To convert any type to a ```String``` is as simple as implementing the ```ToString``` trait for the type. Rather than doing so directly, you should implement the ```fmt::Display``` trait which automagically provides ```ToString``` and also allows printing the type as discussed in the section on ```print!```.

```rust
use std::fmt;

struct Circle {
    radius: i32
}

impl fmt::Display for Circle {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        write!(f, "Circle of radius {}", self.radius)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Circle { radius: 6 };
    println!("{}", circle.to_string());
}
```

Reference [./src/demo27.rs](./src/demo27.rs)

**Parsing a String** 

One of the more common types to convert a string into is a number. The idiomatic approach to this is to use the ```parse``` function and either to arrange for type inference or to specify the type to parse using the 'turbofish' syntax. Both alternatives are shown in the following example.

This will convert the string into the type specified as long as the ```FromStr``` trait is implemented for that type. This is implemented for numerous types within the standard library. To obtain this functionality on a user defined type simply implement the ```FromStr``` trait for that type.

```rust
fn main() {
    let parsed: i32 = "5".parse().unwrap();
    let turbo_parsed = "10".parse::<i32>().unwrap();

    let sum = parsed + turbo_parsed;
    println!("Sum: {:?}", sum);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo28.rs](./src/demo28.rs)

## **7 - Expressions**

A Rust proggram is (mostly) made up of a series of statements

```rust
fn main() {
    // statement
    // statement
    // statement
}
```

There are a few kinds of statements in Rust. The most common two are declaring a variable binding, and use a ```;``` with expression: 

```rust
fn main() {
    // variable binding
    let x = 5;

    // expression;
    x;
    x + 1;
    15;
}
```

Blocks are expressions too, so they can be used as values in assignments. The last expression in the block will be assigned to the place expression such as as local variable. However, if the last expression of the block ends with a semicolon, the return value will be ```()```.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5u32;

    let y = {
        let x_squared = x * x;
        let x_cube = x_squared * x;

        // This expression will be assigned to `y`
        x_cube + x_squared + x
    };

    let z = {
        // The semicolon suppresses this expression and `()` is assigned to `z`
        2 * x;
    };

    println!("x is {:?}", x);
    println!("y is {:?}", y);
    println!("z is {:?}", z);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo29.rs](./src/demo29.rs)

## **8 - Flow of Control**

An integral part of any programming language are ways to modify control flow: ```if/else```, ```for```, and others. Let's talk about them in Rust.

### ***8.1 - if/else***

Branching with ```if-else``` is similar to other languages. Unlike many of them, the boolean condition doesn't need to be surrounded by parentheses, and each condition is followed by a block. ```if-else``` conditionals are expressions, and, all branches must return the same type.

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 5;

    if n < 0 {
        print!("{} is negative", n);
    } else if n > 0 {
        print!("{} is positive", n);
    } else {
        print!("{} is zero", n);
    }

    let big_n =
        if n < 10 && n > -10 {
            println!(", and is a small number, increase ten-fold");

            // This expression returns an `i32`.
            10 * n
        } else {
            println!(", and is a big number, halve the number");

            // This expression must return an `i32` as well.
            n / 2
            // TODO ^ Try suppressing this expression with a semicolon.
        };
    //   ^ Don't forget to put a semicolon here! All `let` bindings need it.

    println!("{} -> {}", n, big_n);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo30.rs](./src/demo30.rs)

### ***8.2 - loop***

Rust provides a ```loop``` keyword to indicate an infinite loop.

The ```break``` statement can be used to exit a loop at anytime, whereas the ```continue``` statement can be used to skip the rest of the iteration and start a new one.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0u32;

    println!("Let's count until infinity!");

    // Infinite loop
    loop {
        count += 1;

        if count == 3 {
            println!("three");

            // Skip the rest of this iteration
            continue;
        }

        println!("{}", count);

        if count == 5 {
            println!("OK, that's enough");

            // Exit this loop
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo31.rs](./src/demo31.rs)

**Nesting and Labels**

It's possible to ```break``` or ```continue``` outer loops when dealing with nested loops. In these cases, the loops must be annotated with some ```'label```, and the label must be passed to the ```break/continue``` statement.

```rust
#![allow(unreachable_code)]

fn main() {
    'outer: loop {
        println!("Entered the outer loop");

        'inner: loop {
            println!("Entered the inner loop");

            // This would break only the inner loop
            //break;

            // This breaks the outer loop
            break 'outer;
        }

        println!("This point will never be reached");
    }

    println!("Exited the outer loop");
}
```

Reference [./src/demo32.rs](./src/demo32.rs)

**Returning from loops**

One of the uses of a ```loop``` is to retry an operation until it succeeds. If the operation returns a value though, you might need to pass it to the rest of the code: put it after the ```break```, and it will be returned by the ```loop``` expression.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    assert_eq!(result, 20);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo33.rs](./src/demo33.rs)

### ***8.3 - while***

The while keyword can be used to run a loop while a condition is true.

Let's write the infamous ```FizzBuzz``` using a while loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    // A counter variable
    let mut n = 1;

    // Loop while `n` is less than 101
    while n < 101 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }

        // Increment counter
        n += 1;
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo34.rs](./src/demo34.rs)

### ***8.4 - for and range***

**for and range** 

The ```for in``` construct can be used to iterate through an ```Iterator```. One of the easiest ways to create an iterator is to use the range notation ```a..b```. This yields values from ```a``` (inclusive) to ```b``` (exclusive) in steps of one.

Let's write FizzBuzz using ```for``` instead of ```while```.

```rust
fn main() {
    // `n` will take the values: 1, 2, ..., 100 in each iteration
    for n in 1..101 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo35.rs](./src/demo35.rs)

Alternatively, ```a..=b``` can be used for a range that is inclusive on both ends. The above can be written as:

```rust
fn main() {
    // `n` will take the values: 1, 2, ..., 100 in each iteration
    for n in 1..=100 {
        if n % 15 == 0 {
            println!("fizzbuzz");
        } else if n % 3 == 0 {
            println!("fizz");
        } else if n % 5 == 0 {
            println!("buzz");
        } else {
            println!("{}", n);
        }
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo36.rs](./src/demo36.rs)

**for and iterators**

The for in construct is able to interact with an ```Iterator``` in several ways. As discussed in the section on the ```Iterator``` trait, by default the ```for``` loop will apply the ```into_iter``` function to the collection. However, this is not the only means of converting collections into iterators.

```into_iter```, ```iter``` and ```iter_mut``` all handle the conversion of a collection into an iterator in different ways, by providing different views on the data within.

* ```iter``` - This borrows each element of the collection through each iteration. Thus leaving the collection untouched and available for reuse after the loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    let names = vec!["Bob", "Frank", "Ferris"];

    for name in names.iter() {
        match name {
            &"Ferris" => println!("There is a rustacean among us!"),
            // TODO ^ Try deleting the & and matching just "Ferris"
            _ => println!("Hello {}", name),
        }
    }
    
    println!("names: {:?}", names);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo37.rs](./src/demo37.rs)

* ```into_iter``` - This consumes the collection so that on each iteration the exact data is provided. Once the collection has been consumed it is no longer available for reuse as it has been 'moved' within the loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    let names = vec!["Bob", "Frank", "Ferris"];

    for name in names.into_iter() {
        match name {
            "Ferris" => println!("There is a rustacean among us!"),
            _ => println!("Hello {}", name),
        }
    }
    
    println!("names: {:?}", names);
    // FIXME ^ Comment out this line
}
```

Reference [./src/demo38.rs](./src/demo38.rs)

* ```iter_mut``` - This mutably borrows each element of the collection, allowing for the collection to be modified in 
place.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut names = vec!["Bob", "Frank", "Ferris"];

    for name in names.iter_mut() {
        *name = match name {
            &mut "Ferris" => "There is a rustacean among us!",
            _ => "Hello",
        }
    }

    println!("names: {:?}", names);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo39.rs](./src/demo39.rs)

In the above snippets note the type of match branch, that is the key difference in the types of iteration. The difference in type then of course implies differing actions that are able to be performed.

### ***8.5 - match***

Rust provides pattern matching via the match keyword, which can be used link C ```switch```. The first matching arm is evaluated and all possible values must be covered.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 13;
    // TODO ^ Try different values for `number`

    println!("Tell me about {}", number);
    match number {
        // Match a single value
        1 => println!("One!"),
        // Match several values
        2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 11 => println!("This is a prime"),
        // TODO ^ Try adding 13 to the list of prime values
        // Match an inclusive range
        13..=19 => println!("A teen"),
        // Handle the rest of cases
        _ => println!("Ain't special"),
        // TODO ^ Try commenting out this catch-all arm
    }

    let boolean = true;
    // Match is an expression too
    let binary = match boolean {
        // The arms of a match must cover all the possible values
        false => 0,
        true => 1,
        // TODO ^ Try commenting out one of these arms
    };

    println!("{} -> {}", boolean, binary);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo40.rs](./src/demo40.rs)

#### ***8.5.1 - Destructuring***

A ```match``` block can destructure items in a variety of ways.

* Destructuring Tuples
* Destructuring Arrays and Slices
* Destructuring Enums
* Destructuring Pointers
* Destructuring Structures

##### ***8.5.1.1 - Destructuring Tuples***

Tuples can be destructured in a ```match``` as follows:

```rust
fn main() {
    let triple = (0, -2, 3);
    // TODO ^ Try different values for `triple`

    println!("Tell me about {:?}", triple);
    // Match can be used to destructure a tuple
    match triple {
        // Destructure the second and third elements
        (0, y, z) => println!("First is `0`, `y` is {:?}, and `z` is {:?}", y, z),
        (1, ..)  => println!("First is `1` and the rest doesn't matter"),
        (.., 2)  => println!("last is `2` and the rest doesn't matter"),
        (3, .., 4)  => println!("First is `3`, last is `4`, and the rest doesn't matter"),
        // `..` can be used to ignore the rest of the tuple
        _      => println!("It doesn't matter what they are"),
        // `_` means don't bind the value to a variable
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo41.rs](./src/demo41.rs)

##### ***8.5.1.2 - Destructuring Arrays and Slices***

Like ```tuples```, ```arrays``` and ```slices``` can be destructured this way:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Try changing the values in the array, or make it a slice!
    let array = [1, -2, 6];

    match array {
        // Binds the second and the third elements to the respective variables
        [0, second, third] =>
            println!("array[0] = 0, array[1] = {}, array[2] = {}", second, third),

        // Single values can be ignored with _
        [1, _, third] => println!(
            "array[0] = 1, array[2] = {} and array[1] was ignored",
            third
        ),

        // You can also bind some and ignore the rest
        [-1, second, ..] => println!(
            "array[0] = -1, array[1] = {} and all the other ones were ignored",
            second
        ),
        // The code below would not compile
        // [-1, second] => ...

        // Or store them in another array/slice (the type depends on
        // that of the value that is being matched against)
        [3, second, tail @ ..] => println!(
            "array[0] = 3, array[1] = {} and the other elements were {:?}",
            second, tail
        ),

        // Combining these patterns, we can, for example, bind the first and
        // last values, and store the rest of them in a single array
        [first, middle @ .., last] => println!(
            "array[0] = {}, middle = {:?}, array[2] = {}",
            first, middle, last
        ),
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo42.rs](./src/demo42.rs)
##### ***8.5.1.3 - Destructuring Enums***

An ```enum``` is destructured similarly

```rust
// `allow` required to silence warnings because only
// one variant is used.
#[allow(dead_code)]
enum Color {
    // These 3 are specified solely by their name.
    Red,
    Blue,
    Green,
    // These likewise tie `u32` tuples to different names: color models.
    RGB(u32, u32, u32),
    HSV(u32, u32, u32),
    HSL(u32, u32, u32),
    CMY(u32, u32, u32),
    CMYK(u32, u32, u32, u32),
}

fn main() {
    let color = Color::RGB(122, 17, 40);
    // TODO ^ Try different variants for `color`

    println!("What color is it?");
    // An `enum` can be destructured using a `match`.
    match color {
        Color::Red   => println!("The color is Red!"),
        Color::Blue  => println!("The color is Blue!"),
        Color::Green => println!("The color is Green!"),
        Color::RGB(r, g, b) =>
            println!("Red: {}, green: {}, and blue: {}!", r, g, b),
        Color::HSV(h, s, v) =>
            println!("Hue: {}, saturation: {}, value: {}!", h, s, v),
        Color::HSL(h, s, l) =>
            println!("Hue: {}, saturation: {}, lightness: {}!", h, s, l),
        Color::CMY(c, m, y) =>
            println!("Cyan: {}, magenta: {}, yellow: {}!", c, m, y),
        Color::CMYK(c, m, y, k) =>
            println!("Cyan: {}, magenta: {}, yellow: {}, key (black): {}!",
                c, m, y, k),
        // Don't need another arm because all variants have been examined
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo43.rs](./src/demo43.rs)

##### ***8.5.1.4 - Destructuring Pointers/Ref***

For pointers, a distinction needs to be made between destructuring and dereferencing as they are different concepts which are used differently from languages like C/c++

* Dereferencing ```*``` 
* Destructuring uses ```&```, ```ref```, and ```ref mut```

```rust
fn main() {
    // Assign a reference of type `i32`. The `&` signifies there
    // is a reference being assigned.
    let reference = &4;

    match reference {
        // If `reference` is pattern matched against `&val`, it results
        // in a comparison like:
        // `&i32`
        // `&val`
        // ^ We see that if the matching `&`s are dropped, then the `i32`
        // should be assigned to `val`.
        &val => println!("Got a value via destructuring: {:?}", val),
    }

    // To avoid the `&`, you dereference before matching.
    match *reference {
        val => println!("Got a value via dereferencing: {:?}", val),
    }

    // What if you don't start with a reference? `reference` was a `&`
    // because the right side was already a reference. This is not
    // a reference because the right side is not one.
    let _not_a_reference = 3;

    // Rust provides `ref` for exactly this purpose. It modifies the
    // assignment so that a reference is created for the element; this
    // reference is assigned.
    let ref _is_a_reference = 3;

    // Accordingly, by defining 2 values without references, references
    // can be retrieved via `ref` and `ref mut`.
    let value = 5;
    let mut mut_value = 6;

    // Use `ref` keyword to create a reference.
    match value {
        ref r => println!("Got a reference to a value: {:?}", r),
    }

    // Use `ref mut` similarly.
    match mut_value {
        ref mut m => {
            // Got a reference. Gotta dereference it before we can
            // add anything to it.
            *m += 10;
            println!("We added 10. `mut_value`: {:?}", m);
        },
    }
}
```

##### ***8.5.1.5 - Destructuring Structures***

Similarly, a ```struct``` can be destructured as shown

```rust
fn main() {
    struct Foo {
        x: (u32, u32),
        y: u32,
    }

    // Try changing the values in the struct to see what happens
    let foo = Foo { x: (1, 2), y: 3 };

    match foo {
        Foo { x: (1, b), y } => println!("First of x is 1, b = {},  y = {} ", b, y),

        // you can destructure structs and rename the variables,
        // the order is not important
        Foo { y: 2, x: i } => println!("y is 2, i = {:?}", i),

        // and you can also ignore some variables:
        Foo { y, .. } => println!("y = {}, we don't care about x", y),
        // this will give an error: pattern does not mention field `x`
        //Foo { y } => println!("y = {}", y),
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo45.rs](./src/demo45.rs)

#### ***8.5.2 - Guards***

A ```match``` *guard* can be added to filter the arm.

```rust
enum Temperature {
    Celsius(i32),
    Farenheit(i32),
}

fn main() {
    let temperature = Temperature::Celsius(35);
    // ^ TODO try different values for `temperature`

    match temperature {
        Temperature::Celsius(t) if t > 30 => println!("{}C is above 30 Celsius", t),
        // The `if condition` part ^ is a guard
        Temperature::Celsius(t) => println!("{}C is below 30 Celsius", t),

        Temperature::Farenheit(t) if t > 86 => println!("{}F is above 86 Farenheit", t),
        Temperature::Farenheit(t) => println!("{}F is below 86 Farenheit", t),
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo46.rs](./src/demo46.rs)

Note that the compiler won't take guard conditions into account when checking if all patterns are covered by the match expression

```rust
fn main() {
    let number: u8 = 4; 

    match number {
        i if i == 0 => println!("Zero"),
        i if i > 0 => println!("Greater than zero"),
        // _ => unreachable!("Should never happen."), 
        // TODO ^ uncomment to fix compilation
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo57.rs](./src/demo47.rs)

#### ***8.5.3 - Binding***

Indirectly accessing a variable makes it impossible to branch and use that variable without rebinding. ```match``` provides the ```@``` sigil for binding values to names

```rust
// A function `age` which returns a `u32`.
fn age() -> u32 {
    15
}

fn main() {
    println!("Tell me what type of person you are");

    match age() {
        0             => println!("I haven't celebrated my first birthday yet"),
        // Could `match` 1 ..= 12 directly but then what age
        // would the child be? Instead, bind to `n` for the
        // sequence of 1 ..= 12. Now the age can be reported.
        n @ 1  ..= 12 => println!("I'm a child of age {:?}", n),
        n @ 13 ..= 19 => println!("I'm a teen of age {:?}", n),
        // Nothing bound. Return the result.
        n             => println!("I'm an old person of age {:?}", n),
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo48.rs](./src/demo48.rs)

You can also use binding to "destructure" ```enum``` variants, such as ```Option```

```rust
fn some_number() -> Option<u32> {
    Some(42)
}

fn main() {
    match some_number() {
        // Got `Some` variant, match if its value, bound to `n`,
        // is equal to 42.
        Some(n @ 42) => println!("The Answer: {}!", n),
        // Match any other number.
        Some(n)      => println!("Not interesting... {}", n),
        // Match anything else (`None` variant).
        _            => (),
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo49.rs](./src/demo49.rs)

### ***8.6 - if let***

For some use cases, when matching enums, ```match``` is awkward. For example

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
// Make `optional` of type `Option<i32>`
let optional = Some(7);

match optional {
    Some(i) => {
        println!("This is a really long string and `{:?}`", i);
        // ^ Needed 2 indentations just so we could destructure
        // `i` from the option.
    },
    _ => {},
    // ^ Required because `match` is exhaustive. Doesn't it seem
    // like wasted space?
};

}
```

```shell
This is a really long string and `7`
```

```if let``` is cleaner for this use case and in addition allows various failure options to be specified

```rust
fn main() {
    // All have type `Option<i32>`
    let number = Some(7);
    let letter: Option<i32> = None;
    let emoticon: Option<i32> = None;

    // The `if let` construct reads: "if `let` destructures `number` into
    // `Some(i)`, evaluate the block (`{}`).
    if let Some(i) = number {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    }

    // If you need to specify a failure, use an else:
    if let Some(i) = letter {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    } else {
        // Destructure failed. Change to the failure case.
        println!("Didn't match a number. Let's go with a letter!");
    }

    // Provide an altered failing condition.
    let i_like_letters = false;

    if let Some(i) = emoticon {
        println!("Matched {:?}!", i);
    // Destructure failed. Evaluate an `else if` condition to see if the
    // alternate failure branch should be taken:
    } else if i_like_letters {
        println!("Didn't match a number. Let's go with a letter!");
    } else {
        // The condition evaluated false. This branch is the default:
        println!("I don't like letters. Let's go with an emoticon :)!");
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo50.rs](./src/demo50.rs)

In the same way, ```if let``` can be used to match any enum value

```rust
// Our example enum
enum Foo {
    Bar,
    Baz,
    Qux(u32)
}

fn main() {
    // Create example variables
    let a = Foo::Bar;
    let b = Foo::Baz;
    let c = Foo::Qux(100);
    
    // Variable a matches Foo::Bar
    if let Foo::Bar = a {
        println!("a is foobar");
    }
    
    // Variable b does not match Foo::Bar
    // So this will print nothing
    if let Foo::Bar = b {
        println!("b is foobar");
    }
    
    // Variable c matches Foo::Qux which has a value
    // Similar to Some() in the previous example
    if let Foo::Qux(value) = c {
        println!("c is {}", value);
    }

    // Binding also works with `if let`
    if let Foo::Qux(value @ 100) = c {
        println!("c is one hundred");
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo51.rs](./src/demo51.rs)

Another benefit is that ```if let``` allows us to match non-parameterized enum variants. This is true even in cases where the enum doesn't implement or derive ```PartialEq```. In such cases ```if Foo::Bar == a``` would fail to compile, because instances of the enum cannot be equated, however ```if let``` will continue to work.

Would you like a challenge? Fix following example to use ```if let```

```rust
// This enum purposely neither implements nor derives PartialEq.
// That is why comparing Foo::Bar == a fails below.
enum Foo {Bar}

fn main() {
    let a = Foo::Bar;

    // Variable a matches Foo::Bar
    if Foo::Bar == a {
    // ^-- this causes a compile-time error. Use `if let` instead.
        println!("a is foobar");
    }
}
```

Reference [./src/demo52.rs](./src/demo52.rs)

### ***8.7 - while let***

Similar to ```if let```, ```while let``` can make awkward ```match``` sequences more tolerable. Consider the following sequence that increments ```i```

```rust
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
// Make `optional` of type `Option<i32>`
let mut optional = Some(0);

// Repeatedly try this test.
loop {
    match optional {
        // If `optional` destructures, evaluate the block.
        Some(i) => {
            if i > 9 {
                println!("Greater than 9, quit!");
                optional = None;
            } else {
                println!("`i` is `{:?}`. Try again.", i);
                optional = Some(i + 1);
            }
            // ^ Requires 3 indentations!
        },
        // Quit the loop when the destructure fails:
        _ => { break; }
        // ^ Why should this be required? There must be a better way!
    }
}
}
```

```shell
`i` is `0`. Try again.
`i` is `1`. Try again.
`i` is `2`. Try again.
`i` is `3`. Try again.
`i` is `4`. Try again.
`i` is `5`. Try again.
`i` is `6`. Try again.
`i` is `7`. Try again.
`i` is `8`. Try again.
`i` is `9`. Try again.
Greater than 9, quit!
```

Using ```while let``` makes this sequence much nicer

```rust
fn main() {
    // Make `optional` of type `Option<i32>`
    let mut optional = Some(0);

    // This reads: "while `let` destructures `optional` into
    // `Some(i)`, evaluate the block (`{}`). Else `break`.
    while let Some(i) = optional {
        if i > 9 {
            println!("Greater than 9, quit!");
            optional = None;
        } else {
            println!("`i` is `{:?}`. Try again.", i);
            optional = Some(i + 1);
        }
        // ^ Less rightward drift and doesn't require
        // explicitly handling the failing case.
    }
    // ^ `if let` had additional optional `else`/`else if`
    // clauses. `while let` does not have these.
}
```

## **9 - Functions**

Function are declared using the ```fn``` keyword. Its arguments are type annotated, just like variables, and, if the function returns a value, the return type must be specified after an arrow ```->```. 

The final expression in the function will be used as return value. Alternatively, the ```return``` statement can be used to return a value earlier from within the function, even from inside loops or ```if``` statement.

Let's rewrite FizzBuzz using function!

```rust
// Unlike C/C++, there's no restriction on the order of function definitions
fn main() {
    // We can use this function here, and define it somewhere later
    fizzbuzz_to(100);
}

// Function that returns a boolean value
fn is_divisible_by(lhs: u32, rhs: u32) -> bool {
    // Corner case, early return
    if rhs == 0 {
        return false;
    }

    // This is an expression, the `return` keyword is not necessary here
    lhs % rhs == 0
}

// Functions that "don't" return a value, actually return the unit type `()`
fn fizzbuzz(n: u32) -> () {
    if is_divisible_by(n, 15) {
        println!("fizzbuzz");
    } else if is_divisible_by(n, 3) {
        println!("fizz");
    } else if is_divisible_by(n, 5) {
        println!("buzz");
    } else {
        println!("{}", n);
    }
}

// When a function returns `()`, the return type can be omitted from the
// signature
fn fizzbuzz_to(n: u32) {
    for n in 1..=n {
        fizzbuzz(n);
    }
}
```

### ***9.1 - Methods***

**Associated functions & Methods**

Some functions are connected to a particular type. These come in two forms: associated functions, and methods. Associated functions are functions that are defined on a type generally, while methods are associated functions that are called on a particular instance of type.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Implementation block, all `Point` associated functions & methods go in here
impl Point {
    // This is an "associated function" because this function is associated with
    // a particular type, that is, Point.
    //
    // Associated functions don't need to be called with an instance.
    // These functions are generally used like constructors.
    fn origin() -> Point {
        Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
    }

    // Another associated function, taking two arguments:
    fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -> Point {
        Point { x: x, y: y }
    }
}

struct Rectangle {
    p1: Point,
    p2: Point,
}

impl Rectangle {
    // This is a method
    // `&self` is sugar for `self: &Self`, where `Self` is the type of the
    // caller object. In this case `Self` = `Rectangle`
    fn area(&self) -> f64 {
        // `self` gives access to the struct fields via the dot operator
        let Point { x: x1, y: y1 } = self.p1;
        let Point { x: x2, y: y2 } = self.p2;

        // `abs` is a `f64` method that returns the absolute value of the
        // caller
        ((x1 - x2) * (y1 - y2)).abs()
    }

    fn perimeter(&self) -> f64 {
        let Point { x: x1, y: y1 } = self.p1;
        let Point { x: x2, y: y2 } = self.p2;

        2.0 * ((x1 - x2).abs() + (y1 - y2).abs())
    }

    // This method requires the caller object to be mutable
    // `&mut self` desugars to `self: &mut Self`
    fn translate(&mut self, x: f64, y: f64) {
        self.p1.x += x;
        self.p2.x += x;

        self.p1.y += y;
        self.p2.y += y;
    }
}

// `Pair` owns resources: two heap allocated integers
struct Pair(Box<i32>, Box<i32>);

impl Pair {
    // This method "consumes" the resources of the caller object
    // `self` desugars to `self: Self`
    fn destroy(self) {
        // Destructure `self`
        let Pair(first, second) = self;

        println!("Destroying Pair({}, {})", first, second);

        // `first` and `second` go out of scope and get freed
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rectangle = Rectangle {
        // Associated functions are called using double colons
        p1: Point::origin(),
        p2: Point::new(3.0, 4.0),
    };

    // Methods are called using the dot operator
    // Note that the first argument `&self` is implicitly passed, i.e.
    // `rectangle.perimeter()` === `Rectangle::perimeter(&rectangle)`
    println!("Rectangle perimeter: {}", rectangle.perimeter());
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", rectangle.area());

    let mut square = Rectangle {
        p1: Point::origin(),
        p2: Point::new(1.0, 1.0),
    };

    // Error! `rectangle` is immutable, but this method requires a mutable
    // object
    //rectangle.translate(1.0, 0.0);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // Okay! Mutable objects can call mutable methods
    square.translate(1.0, 1.0);

    let pair = Pair(Box::new(1), Box::new(2));

    pair.destroy();

    // Error! Previous `destroy` call "consumed" `pair`
    //pair.destroy();
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```

Reference [./src/demo55.rs](./src/demo55.rs)

### ***9.2 - Closures***

Closures are functions that can capture the enclosing environment. For example, a closure that captures the ```x``` variable:

```shell
|val| val + x
```

The syntax and capabilities of closures make them very convenient for on the fly usage. Calling a closure is exactly like calling a function. However, both input and return types *can* be inferred and input variable names *must* be specified.

Other characteristics of closures include: 

* Using ```||``` instead of ```()``` around input variables. 
* Optional body delimination ( ```{}``` ) for a single expression (mandatory otherwise). 
* The ability to capture the outer environment variables.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Increment via closures and functions.
    fn function(i: i32) -> i32 { i + 1 }

    // Closures are anonymous, here we are binding them to references
    // Annotation is identical to function annotation but is optional
    // as are the `{}` wrapping the body. These nameless functions
    // are assigned to appropriately named variables.
    let closure_annotated = |i: i32| -> i32 { i + 1 };
    let closure_inferred  = |i     |          i + 1  ;

    let i = 1;
    // Call the function and closures.
    println!("function: {}", function(i));
    println!("closure_annotated: {}", closure_annotated(i));
    println!("closure_inferred: {}", closure_inferred(i));
    // Once closure's type has been inferred, it cannot be inferred again with another type.
    //println!("cannot reuse closure_inferred with another type: {}", closure_inferred(42i64));
    // TODO: uncomment the line above and see the compiler error.

    // A closure taking no arguments which returns an `i32`.
    // The return type is inferred.
    let one = || 1;
    println!("closure returning one: {}", one());

}
```

Reference [./src/demo56.rs](./src/demo56.rs)

#### ***9.2.1 - Capturing***

Closures are inherently flexible and will do what the functionality requires to make the closure work without annotation. This allows capturing to flexibly adapt to the use case, sometimes moving and sometimes borrowing. Closures can capture variables:

* by reference: ```&T```
* by mutable reference: ```&mut T```
* by value: ```T```

They preferentially capture variables by reference and only go lower when required.

```rust
fn main() {
    use std::mem;
    
    let color = String::from("green");

    // A closure to print `color` which immediately borrows (`&`) `color` and
    // stores the borrow and closure in the `print` variable. It will remain
    // borrowed until `print` is used the last time. 
    //
    // `println!` only requires arguments by immutable reference so it doesn't
    // impose anything more restrictive.
    let print = || println!("`color`: {}", color);

    // Call the closure using the borrow.
    print();

    // `color` can be borrowed immutably again, because the closure only holds
    // an immutable reference to `color`. 
    let _reborrow = &color;
    print();

    // A move or reborrow is allowed after the final use of `print`
    let _color_moved = color;


    let mut count = 0;
    // A closure to increment `count` could take either `&mut count` or `count`
    // but `&mut count` is less restrictive so it takes that. Immediately
    // borrows `count`.
    //
    // A `mut` is required on `inc` because a `&mut` is stored inside. Thus,
    // calling the closure mutates the closure which requires a `mut`.
    let mut inc = || {
        count += 1;
        println!("`count`: {}", count);
    };

    // Call the closure using a mutable borrow.
    inc();

    // The closure still mutably borrows `count` because it is called later.
    // An attempt to reborrow will lead to an error.
    // let _reborrow = &count; 
    // ^ TODO: try uncommenting this line.
    inc();

    // The closure no longer needs to borrow `&mut count`. Therefore, it is
    // possible to reborrow without an error
    let _count_reborrowed = &mut count; 

    
    // A non-copy type.
    let movable = Box::new(3);

    // `mem::drop` requires `T` so this must take by value. A copy type
    // would copy into the closure leaving the original untouched.
    // A non-copy must move and so `movable` immediately moves into
    // the closure.
    let consume = || {
        println!("`movable`: {:?}", movable);
        mem::drop(movable);
    };

    // `consume` consumes the variable so this can only be called once.
    consume();
    // consume();
    // ^ TODO: Try uncommenting this line.
}
```

Reference [./src/demo57.rs](./src/demo57.rs)

Using ```move``` before vertical pipes forces closure to take ownership of captured variables

```rust
fn main() {
    // `Vec` has non-copy semantics.
    let haystack = vec![1, 2, 3];

    let contains = move |needle| haystack.contains(needle);

    println!("{}", contains(&1));
    println!("{}", contains(&4));

    // println!("There're {} elements in vec", haystack.len());
    // ^ Uncommenting above line will result in compile-time error
    // because borrow checker doesn't allow re-using variable after it
    // has been moved.
    
    // Removing `move` from closure's signature will cause closure
    // to borrow _haystack_ variable immutably, hence _haystack_ is still
    // available and uncommenting above line will not cause an error.
}
```

Reference [./src/demo58.rs](./src/demo58.rs)

#### ***9.2.2 - As input parameters***

While Rust chooses how to capture variables on the fly mostly without type annotation, this ambiguity is not allowed when writing functions. When taking a closure as an input parameter, the closure's complete type must be annotated using one of a few ```traits```, and they're determined by what the closure does with captured value. In order of decreasing restriction, they are:

* ```Fn```: the closure uses the captured value by reference (```&T```)
* ```FnMut```: the closure uses the captured value by mutable reference (```&mut T```)
* ```FnOnce```: the closure uses the captured value by value (```T```)

On a variable-by-variable basis, the compiler will capture variables in the least restrictive manner possible.

For instance, consider a parameter annotated as ```FnOnce```. This specifies that the closure may capture by ```&T```, ```&mut T```, or ```T```, but the compiler will ultimately choose based on how the captured variables are used in the closure.

This is because if a move is possible, then any type of borrow should also be possible. Note that the reverse is not true. If the parameter is annotated as ```Fn```, then capturing variables by ```&mut T``` or ```T``` are not allowed.

In the following example, try swapping the usage of ```Fn```, ```FnMut```, and ```FnOnce``` to see what happens:

```rust
// A function which takes a closure as an argument and calls it.
// <F> denotes that F is a "Generic type parameter"
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    // The closure takes no input and returns nothing.
    F: FnOnce() {
    // ^ TODO: Try changing this to `Fn` or `FnMut`.

    f();
}

// A function which takes a closure and returns an `i32`.
fn apply_to_3<F>(f: F) -> i32 where
    // The closure takes an `i32` and returns an `i32`.
    F: Fn(i32) -> i32 {

    f(3)
}

fn main() {
    use std::mem;

    let greeting = "hello";
    // A non-copy type.
    // `to_owned` creates owned data from borrowed one
    let mut farewell = "goodbye".to_owned();

    // Capture 2 variables: `greeting` by reference and
    // `farewell` by value.
    let diary = || {
        // `greeting` is by reference: requires `Fn`.
        println!("I said {}.", greeting);

        // Mutation forces `farewell` to be captured by
        // mutable reference. Now requires `FnMut`.
        farewell.push_str("!!!");
        println!("Then I screamed {}.", farewell);
        println!("Now I can sleep. zzzzz");

        // Manually calling drop forces `farewell` to
        // be captured by value. Now requires `FnOnce`.
        mem::drop(farewell);
    };

    // Call the function which applies the closure.
    apply(diary);

    // `double` satisfies `apply_to_3`'s trait bound
    let double = |x| 2 * x;

    println!("3 doubled: {}", apply_to_3(double));
}
```

#### ***9.2.3 - Type anonymity***

Closures succinctly capture variables from enclosing scopes. Does this have any consequences? It surely does. Observe how using a closure as a function parameter requires ```generics```, which is necessary because of how they are defined:

```rust
// `F` must be generic.
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    F: FnOnce() {
    f();
}
```

When a closure is defined, the compiler implicitly creates a new anonymous structure to store the captured variables inside, meanwhile implementing the functionality via one of the traits: ```Fn```, ```FnMut```, or ```FnOnce``` for this unknown type. This type is assigned to the variable which is stored until calling.

Since this new type is of unknown type, any usage in a function will require generics. However, an unbounded type parameter ```<T>``` would still be ambiguous and not be allowed. Thus, bounding by one of the traits: ```Fn```, ```FnMut```, or ```FnOnce``` (which it implements) is sufficient to specify its type.

```rust
// `F` must implement `Fn` for a closure which takes no
// inputs and returns nothing - exactly what is required
// for `print`.
fn apply<F>(f: F) where
    F: Fn() {
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let x = 7;

    // Capture `x` into an anonymous type and implement
    // `Fn` for it. Store it in `print`.
    let print = || println!("{}", x);

    apply(print);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo60.rs](./src/demo60.rs)

#### ***9.2.4 - Input functions***

Since closures may be used as arguments, you might wonder if the same can be said about functions. And indeed they can! If you declare a function that takes a closure as parameter, then any function that satisfies the trait bound of that closure can be passed as a parameter.

```rust
// Define a function which takes a generic `F` argument
// bounded by `Fn`, and calls it
fn call_me<F: Fn()>(f: F) {
    f();
}

// Define a wrapper function satisfying the `Fn` bound
fn function() {
    println!("I'm a function!");
}

fn main() {
    // Define a closure satisfying the `Fn` bound
    let closure = || println!("I'm a closure!");

    call_me(closure);
    call_me(function);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo61.rs](./src/demo61.rs)

As an additional note, the ```Fn```, ```FnMut```, and ```FnOnce``` traits dictate how a closure captures variables from the enclosing scope.

#### ***9.2.5 - As output parameters***

Closures as input parameters are possible, so returning closures as output parameters should also be possible. However, anonymous closure types are, by definition, unknown, so we have to use ```impl``` Trait to return them.

The valid traits for returning a closure are:

* ```Fn```
* ```FnMut```
* ```FnOnce```

Beyond this, the ```move``` keyword must be used, which signals that all captures occur by value. This is required because any captures by reference would be dropped as soon as the function exited, leaving invalid references in the closure.

```rust
fn create_fn() -> impl Fn() {
    let text = "Fn".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn create_fnmut() -> impl FnMut() {
    let text = "FnMut".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn create_fnonce() -> impl FnOnce() {
    let text = "FnOnce".to_owned();

    move || println!("This is a: {}", text)
}

fn main() {
    let fn_plain = create_fn();
    let mut fn_mut = create_fnmut();
    let fn_once = create_fnonce();

    fn_plain();
    fn_mut();
    fn_once();
}
```

#### ***9.2.6 - Example in std***

This section contains a few examples of using closures from the ```std``` library.

##### ***9.2.6.1 - Iterator::any***

```Iterator::any``` is a function which when passed an iterator, will return true if any element satisfies the predicate. Otherwise ```false```. Its signature:


```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    // The type being iterated over.
    type Item;

    // `any` takes `&mut self` meaning the caller may be borrowed
    // and modified, but not consumed.
    fn any<F>(&mut self, f: F) -> bool where
        // `FnMut` meaning any captured variable may at most be
        // modified, not consumed. `Self::Item` states it takes
        // arguments to the closure by value.
        F: FnMut(Self::Item) -> bool;
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec![4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`. Destructure to `i32`.
    println!("2 in vec1: {}", vec1.iter()     .any(|&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`. No destructuring required.
    println!("2 in vec2: {}", vec2.into_iter().any(| x| x == 2));

    // `iter()` only borrows `vec1` and its elements, so they can be used again
    println!("vec1 len: {}", vec1.len());
    println!("First element of vec1 is: {}", vec1[0]);
    // `into_iter()` does move `vec2` and its elements, so they cannot be used again
    // println!("First element of vec2 is: {}", vec2[0]);
    // println!("vec2 len: {}", vec2.len());
    // TODO: uncomment two lines above and see compiler errors.

    let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let array2 = [4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for arrays yields `&i32`.
    println!("2 in array1: {}", array1.iter()     .any(|&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for arrays yields `i32`.
    println!("2 in array2: {}", array2.into_iter().any(|x| x == 2));
}
```

Reference [./src/demo63.rs](./src/demo63.rs)

##### ***9.2.6.2 - Searching through iterators***

```Iterator::find``` is a function which iterates over an iterator and searches for the first value which satisfies some condition. If none of the values satisfy the condition, it returns ```None```. Its signature:

```rust
pub trait Iterator {
    // The type being iterated over.
    type Item;

    // `find` takes `&mut self` meaning the caller may be borrowed
    // and modified, but not consumed.
    fn find<P>(&mut self, predicate: P) -> Option<Self::Item> where
        // `FnMut` meaning any captured variable may at most be
        // modified, not consumed. `&Self::Item` states it takes
        // arguments to the closure by reference.
        P: FnMut(&Self::Item) -> bool;
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let vec2 = vec![4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`.
    let mut iter = vec1.iter();
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`.
    let mut into_iter = vec2.into_iter();

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32`, and we want to reference one of its
    // items, so we have to destructure `&&i32` to `i32`
    println!("Find 2 in vec1: {:?}", iter     .find(|&&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32`, and we want to reference one of
    // its items, so we have to destructure `&i32` to `i32`
    println!("Find 2 in vec2: {:?}", into_iter.find(| &x| x == 2));

    let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
    let array2 = [4, 5, 6];

    // `iter()` for arrays yields `&i32`
    println!("Find 2 in array1: {:?}", array1.iter()     .find(|&&x| x == 2));
    // `into_iter()` for arrays yields `i32`
    println!("Find 2 in array2: {:?}", array2.into_iter().find(|&x| x == 2));
}
```

Reference [/src/demo64.rs](./src/demo64.rs)

```Iterator::find``` gives you a reference to the item. But if you want the *index* of the item, use ```Iterator::position```.

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![1, 9, 3, 3, 13, 2];

    // `iter()` for vecs yields `&i32` and `position()` does not take a reference, so
    // we have to destructure `&i32` to `i32`
    let index_of_first_even_number = vec.iter().position(|&x| x % 2 == 0);
    assert_eq!(index_of_first_even_number, Some(5));
    
    // `into_iter()` for vecs yields `i32` and `position()` does not take a reference, so
    // we do not have to destructure    
    let index_of_first_negative_number = vec.into_iter().position(|x| x < 0);
    assert_eq!(index_of_first_negative_number, None);
}
```

### ***9.3 - Higher Order Functions***

Rust provides Higher Order Functions (HOF). These are functions that take one or more functions and/or produce a more useful function. HOFs and lazy iterators give Rust its functional flavor.

```rust
fn is_odd(n: u32) -> bool {
    n % 2 == 1
}

fn main() {
    println!("Find the sum of all the squared odd numbers under 1000");
    let upper = 1000;

    // Imperative approach
    // Declare accumulator variable
    let mut acc = 0;
    // Iterate: 0, 1, 2, ... to infinity
    for n in 0.. {
        // Square the number
        let n_squared = n * n;

        if n_squared >= upper {
            // Break loop if exceeded the upper limit
            break;
        } else if is_odd(n_squared) {
            // Accumulate value, if it's odd
            acc += n_squared;
        }
    }
    println!("imperative style: {}", acc);

    // Functional approach
    let sum_of_squared_odd_numbers: u32 =
        (0..).map(|n| n * n)                             // All natural numbers squared
             .take_while(|&n_squared| n_squared < upper) // Below upper limit
             .filter(|&n_squared| is_odd(n_squared))     // That are odd
             .sum();                                     // Sum them
    println!("functional style: {}", sum_of_squared_odd_numbers);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo66.rs](./src/demo66.rs)

```Option``` and ```Iterator``` implement their fair share of HOFs

### ***9.4 - Diverging Functions***

Diverging functions never return. They are marked using ```!```, which is an empty type.

```rust
fn foo() -> ! {
    panic!("This call never returns.");
}
```

As opposed to all the other types, this one cannot be instantiated, because the set of all possible values this type can have is empty. Note that, it is different from the ```()``` type, which has exactly one possible value.

For example, this function returns as usual, although there is no information in the return value.

```rust
fn some_fn() {
    ()
}

fn main() {
    let a: () = some_fn();
    println!("This function returns and you can see this line.");
}
```

As opposed to this function, which will never return the control back to the caller.

```rust
#![feture(newver_type)]

fn main() {
    let x: ! = panic("This call never return.");
    println!("You will never see this line!");
}
```

Although this might seem like an abstract concept, it is in fact very useful and often handy. The main advantage of this type is that it can be cast to any other one and therefore used at places where an exact type is required, for instance in ```match``` branches. This allows us to write code like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    fn sum_odd_numbers(up_to: u32) -> u32 {
        let mut acc = 0;
        for i in 0..up_to {
            // Notice that the return type of this match expression must be u32
            // because of the type of the "addition" variable.
            let addition: u32 = match i%2 == 1 {
                // The "i" variable is of type u32, which is perfectly fine.
                true => i,
                // On the other hand, the "continue" expression does not return
                // u32, but it is still fine, because it never returns and therefore
                // does not violate the type requirements of the match expression.
                false => continue,
            };
            acc += addition;
        }
        acc
    }
    println!("Sum of odd numbers up to 9 (excluding): {}", sum_odd_numbers(9));
}
```

Reference [./src/demo67.rs](./src/demo67.rs)

It is also return type of functions that loop forever (e.g. ```loop {}```) like network servers or functions that terminate the process (e.g. ```exit()```).
