### ***1.1 - Comment***

Rust support a few different varieties: 

* Regular comment with are ignored by the compiler:

```rust
// line comments which go to the end of the line.
/* block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */
```

* Doc comments which are parsed into HTML library documentation (at 24. Meta -> 24.1  Document): 

```rust
/// generate library docs for the following item. 
//! generate library docs for the enclosing item.
```

### ***1.2 - Formatted print***

Printing is handled by a series of macro defined std::fmt some of which include:

* ***format!*** - write formatted text to String
* ***print!*** - same as *format!* but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout)
* ***println!*** - same as *print!* but a newline is appended.
* ***eprint!*** - same as *print!* but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr). 
* ***eprintln!*** - same as *eprint!* but a newline appended.

```rust
fn main() {
    // In general, the `{}` will be automatically replaced with any
    // arguments. These will be stringified.
    println!("{} days", 31);

    // Positional arguments can be used. Specifying an integer inside `{}`
    // determines which additional argument will be replaced. Arguments start
    // at 0 immediately after the format string
    println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");

    // As can named arguments.
    println!("{subject} {verb} {object}",
             object="the lazy dog",
             subject="the quick brown fox",
             verb="jumps over");

    // Different formatting can be invoked by specifying the format character after a
    // `:`.
    println!("Base 10:               {}",   69420); //69420
    println!("Base 2 (binary):       {:b}", 69420); //10000111100101100
    println!("Base 8 (octal):        {:o}", 69420); //207454
    println!("Base 16 (hexadecimal): {:x}", 69420); //10f2c
    println!("Base 16 (hexadecimal): {:X}", 69420); //10F2C


    // You can right-justify text with a specified width. This will
    // output "    1". (Four white spaces and a "1", for a total width of 5.)
    println!("{number:>5}", number=1);

    // You can pad numbers with extra zeroes,
    //and left-adjust by flipping the sign. This will output "10000".
    println!("{number:0<5}", number=1);

    // You can use named arguments in the format specifier by appending a `$`
    println!("{number:0>width$}", number=1, width=5);


    // Rust even checks to make sure the correct number of arguments are
    // used.
    println!("My name is {0}, {1} {0}", "Bond");
    // FIXME ^ Add the missing argument: "James"

    // Only types that implement fmt::Display can be formatted with `{}`. User-
    // defined types do not implement fmt::Display by default

    #[allow(dead_code)]
    struct Structure(i32);

    // This will not compile because `Structure` does not implement
    // fmt::Display
    //println!("This struct `{}` won't print...", Structure(3));
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // For Rust 1.58 and above, you can directly capture the argument from a
    // surrounding variable. Just like the above, this will output
    // "     1". 5 white spaces and a "1".
    let number: f64 = 1.0;
    let width: usize = 5;
    println!("{number:>width$}");
}
```
#### ***1.2.1 - Debug***

Using ```{:?}``` to debug

```rust
// Derive the `fmt::Debug` implementation for `Structure`. `Structure`
// is a structure which contains a single `i32`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Structure(i32);

// Put a `Structure` inside of the structure `Deep`. Make it printable
// also.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Deep(Structure);

fn main() {
    // Printing with `{:?}` is similar to with `{}`.
    println!("{:?} months in a year.", 12);
    println!("{1:?} {0:?} is the {actor:?} name.",
             "Slater",
             "Christian",
             actor="actor's");

    // `Structure` is printable!
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Structure(3));
    
    // The problem with `derive` is there is no control over how
    // the results look. What if I want this to just show a `7`?
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Deep(Structure(7)));
}
```

Pretty printing with ***{:#?}***

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    age: u8
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Peter";
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Pretty print
    println!("{:#?}", peter);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo02.rs](./src/demo02.rs)

#### ***1.2.2 - Display***

```fmt::Debug``` hardly look compact and clean, so it is often advantageous to customize the output appearance. This is done by manually implementing ```fmt::Display```, which uses the ```{}``` print marker. Implement it look like this: 

```rust
// Import (via `use`) the `fmt` module to make it available.
use std::fmt;

// Define a structure for which `fmt::Display` will be implemented. This is
// a tuple struct named `Structure` that contains an `i32`.
struct Structure(i32);

// To use the `{}` marker, the trait `fmt::Display` must be implemented
// manually for the type.
impl fmt::Display for Structure {
    // This trait requires `fmt` with this exact signature.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Write strictly the first element into the supplied output
        // stream: `f`. Returns `fmt::Result` which indicates whether the
        // operation succeeded or failed. Note that `write!` uses syntax which
        // is very similar to `println!`.
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}
```

```fmt::Display``` may be cleaner than ```fmt::Debug``` but this presents a problem for the std library. How should ambiguous types be displayed? For example, if the std library implemented a single style for all ```Vec<T>```, what style should it be? Would it be either of these two?

* ```Vec<path>```: ```/:/etc/home/username:/bin``` (split on ```:```)
* ```Vec<number>```: ```1, 2, 3``` (split on ```,```)

No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the ```std``` library doesn't presume to dictate one. ```fmt::Display``` is not implemented for ```Vec<T>``` or for any other generic containers. ```fmt::Debug``` must then be used for these for generic cases.

This is not a problem though because for any new container type which is not generic, ```fmt::Display``` can be implemented.

```rust
use std::fmt; // Import `fmt`

// A structure holding two numbers. `Debug` will be derived so the results can
// be contrasted with `Display`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MinMax(i64, i64);

// Implement `Display` for `MinMax`.
impl fmt::Display for MinMax {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Use `self.number` to refer to each positional data point.
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.0, self.1)
    }
}

// Define a structure where the fields are nameable for comparison.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point2D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Similarly, implement `Display` for `Point2D`
impl fmt::Display for Point2D {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Customize so only `x` and `y` are denoted.
        write!(f, "x: {}, y: {}", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let minmax = MinMax(0, 14);

    println!("Compare structures:");
    println!("Display: {}", minmax);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", minmax);

    let big_range =   MinMax(-300, 300);
    let small_range = MinMax(-3, 3);

    println!("The big range is {big} and the small is {small}",
             small = small_range,
             big = big_range);

    let point = Point2D { x: 3.3, y: 7.2 };

    println!("Compare points:");
    println!("Display: {}", point);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", point);

    // Error. Both `Debug` and `Display` were implemented, but `{:b}`
    // requires `fmt::Binary` to be implemented. This will not work.
    // println!("What does Point2D look like in binary: {:b}?", point);
}
```

So, ```fmt::Display``` has been implemented but ```fmt::Binary``` has not, and therefore cannot be used. ```std::fmt``` has many such ```traits``` and each requires its own implementation. This is detailed further in ```std::fmt```.

**Activity**

After checking the output of the above example, use the ```Point2D``` struct as a guide to add a ```Complex``` struct to the example. When printed in the same way, the output should be:

```shell
Display: 3.3 + 7.2i
Debug: Complex { real: 3.3, image: 7.2 }
```

**Testcase: List**

Implementing ```fmt::Display``` for a structure where the elements must each be handled sequentially is tricky. The problem is that each ```write!``` generates a ```fmt::Result```. Proper handling of this requires dealing with *all* the results. Rust provides the ```?``` operator for exactly this purpose.

Using ```?``` on ```write!``` looks like this:

```rust
// Try `write!` to see if it errors.
// If it errors, return the error. Otherwise continue
write!(f, "{}", value)?;
```

With ```?``` available, implementing ```fmt::Display``` for a ```Vec``` is straightforward:

```rust
use std::fmt; // Import the `fmt` module.

// Define a structure named `List` containing a `Vec`.
struct List(Vec<i32>);

impl fmt::Display for List {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Extract the value using tuple indexing,
        // and create a reference to `vec`.
        let vec = &self.0;

        write!(f, "[")?;

        // Iterate over `v` in `vec` while enumerating the iteration
        // count in `count`.
        for (count, v) in vec.iter().enumerate() {
            // For every element except the first, add a comma.
            // Use the ? operator to return on errors.
            if count != 0 { write!(f, ", ")?; }
            write!(f, "{}", v)?;
        }

        // Close the opened bracket and return a fmt::Result value.
        write!(f, "]");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let v = List(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    println!("{}", v);
}
```

**Activity**

Try changing the program so that the index of each element in the vector is also printed. The new output should look like this:

```rust
[0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3]
```

#### ***1.2.3 - Formatting***

We've seen that formatting is specified via a *format string*:

* ```format!("{}", foo) -> "3735928559"```
* ```format!(0x{:X}, foo) -> "0xDEADBEEF"```
* ```format!(0o{:o}, foo) -> "0o33653337357"```

The same variable (```foo```) can be formatted differently depending on which *argument type* is used: ```x``` vs ```o``` vs ```unspecified```.

This formatting functionally is implemented via trails, and there is one trait for each argument type. The most common formatting trait is ```Display```, which handles cases where the argument type is left unspecified ```{}``` for instance.

```rust
use std::fmt::{self, Formatter, Display};

struct City {
    name: &'static str,
    // Latitude
    lat: f32,
    // Longitude
    lon: f32,
}

impl Display for City {
    // `f` is a buffer, and this method must write the formatted string into it
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        let lat_c = if self.lat >= 0.0 { 'N' } else { 'S' };
        let lon_c = if self.lon >= 0.0 { 'E' } else { 'W' };

        // `write!` is like `format!`, but it will write the formatted string
        // into a buffer (the first argument)
        write!(f, "{}: {:.3}°{} {:.3}°{}",
               self.name, self.lat.abs(), lat_c, self.lon.abs(), lon_c)
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Color {
    red: u8,
    green: u8,
    blue: u8,
}

fn main() {
    for city in [
        City { name: "Dublin", lat: 53.347778, lon: -6.259722 },
        City { name: "Oslo", lat: 59.95, lon: 10.75 },
        City { name: "Vancouver", lat: 49.25, lon: -123.1 },
    ].iter() {
        println!("{}", *city);
    }
    for color in [
        Color { red: 128, green: 255, blue: 90 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 3, blue: 254 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0 },
    ].iter() {
        // Switch this to use {} once you've added an implementation
        // for fmt::Display.
        println!("{:?}", *color);
    }
}
```

**Activity**

Add an implementation of the ```fmt::Display``` trait for the ```Color``` struct above so that the output displays as: 

```shell
RGB (128, 255, 90) 0x80FF5A
RGB (0, 3, 254) 0x0003FE
RGB (0, 0, 0) 0x000000
```
