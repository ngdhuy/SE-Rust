### ***1.1 - Comment***

Rust support a few different varieties: 

* Regular comment with are ignored by the compiler:

```rust
// line comments which go to the end of the line.
/* block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */
```

* Doc comments which are parsed into HTML library documentation (at 24. Meta -> 24.1  Document): 

```rust
/// generate library docs for the following item. 
//! generate library docs for the enclosing item.
```

### ***1.2 - Formatted print***

Printing is handled by a series of macro defined std::fmt some of which include:

* ***format!*** - write formatted text to String
* ***print!*** - same as *format!* but the text is printed to the console (io::stdout)
* ***println!*** - same as *print!* but a newline is appended.
* ***eprint!*** - same as *print!* but the text is printed to the standard error (io::stderr). 
* ***eprintln!*** - same as *eprint!* but a newline appended.

```rust
fn main() {
    // In general, the `{}` will be automatically replaced with any
    // arguments. These will be stringified.
    println!("{} days", 31);

    // Positional arguments can be used. Specifying an integer inside `{}`
    // determines which additional argument will be replaced. Arguments start
    // at 0 immediately after the format string
    println!("{0}, this is {1}. {1}, this is {0}", "Alice", "Bob");

    // As can named arguments.
    println!("{subject} {verb} {object}",
             object="the lazy dog",
             subject="the quick brown fox",
             verb="jumps over");

    // Different formatting can be invoked by specifying the format character after a
    // `:`.
    println!("Base 10:               {}",   69420); //69420
    println!("Base 2 (binary):       {:b}", 69420); //10000111100101100
    println!("Base 8 (octal):        {:o}", 69420); //207454
    println!("Base 16 (hexadecimal): {:x}", 69420); //10f2c
    println!("Base 16 (hexadecimal): {:X}", 69420); //10F2C


    // You can right-justify text with a specified width. This will
    // output "    1". (Four white spaces and a "1", for a total width of 5.)
    println!("{number:>5}", number=1);

    // You can pad numbers with extra zeroes,
    //and left-adjust by flipping the sign. This will output "10000".
    println!("{number:0<5}", number=1);

    // You can use named arguments in the format specifier by appending a `$`
    println!("{number:0>width$}", number=1, width=5);


    // Rust even checks to make sure the correct number of arguments are
    // used.
    println!("My name is {0}, {1} {0}", "Bond");
    // FIXME ^ Add the missing argument: "James"

    // Only types that implement fmt::Display can be formatted with `{}`. User-
    // defined types do not implement fmt::Display by default

    #[allow(dead_code)]
    struct Structure(i32);

    // This will not compile because `Structure` does not implement
    // fmt::Display
    //println!("This struct `{}` won't print...", Structure(3));
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line

    // For Rust 1.58 and above, you can directly capture the argument from a
    // surrounding variable. Just like the above, this will output
    // "     1". 5 white spaces and a "1".
    let number: f64 = 1.0;
    let width: usize = 5;
    println!("{number:>width$}");
}
```
#### ***1.2.1 - Debug***

Using ```{:?}``` to debug

```rust
// Derive the `fmt::Debug` implementation for `Structure`. `Structure`
// is a structure which contains a single `i32`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Structure(i32);

// Put a `Structure` inside of the structure `Deep`. Make it printable
// also.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Deep(Structure);

fn main() {
    // Printing with `{:?}` is similar to with `{}`.
    println!("{:?} months in a year.", 12);
    println!("{1:?} {0:?} is the {actor:?} name.",
             "Slater",
             "Christian",
             actor="actor's");

    // `Structure` is printable!
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Structure(3));
    
    // The problem with `derive` is there is no control over how
    // the results look. What if I want this to just show a `7`?
    println!("Now {:?} will print!", Deep(Structure(7)));
}
```

Pretty printing with ***{:#?}***

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    age: u8
}

fn main() {
    let name = "Peter";
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Pretty print
    println!("{:#?}", peter);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo02.rs](./src/demo02.rs)

#### ***1.2.2 - Display***

```fmt::Debug``` hardly look compact and clean, so it is often advantageous to customize the output appearance. This is done by manually implementing ```fmt::Display```, which uses the ```{}``` print marker. Implement it look like this: 

```rust
// Import (via `use`) the `fmt` module to make it available.
use std::fmt;

// Define a structure for which `fmt::Display` will be implemented. This is
// a tuple struct named `Structure` that contains an `i32`.
struct Structure(i32);

// To use the `{}` marker, the trait `fmt::Display` must be implemented
// manually for the type.
impl fmt::Display for Structure {
    // This trait requires `fmt` with this exact signature.
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Write strictly the first element into the supplied output
        // stream: `f`. Returns `fmt::Result` which indicates whether the
        // operation succeeded or failed. Note that `write!` uses syntax which
        // is very similar to `println!`.
        write!(f, "{}", self.0)
    }
}
```

```fmt::Display``` may be cleaner than ```fmt::Debug``` but this presents a problem for the std library. How should ambiguous types be displayed? For example, if the std library implemented a single style for all ```Vec<T>```, what style should it be? Would it be either of these two?

* ```Vec<path>```: ```/:/etc/home/username:/bin``` (split on ```:```)
* ```Vec<number>```: ```1, 2, 3``` (split on ```,```)

No, because there is no ideal style for all types and the ```std``` library doesn't presume to dictate one. ```fmt::Display``` is not implemented for ```Vec<T>``` or for any other generic containers. ```fmt::Debug``` must then be used for these for generic cases.

This is not a problem though because for any new container type which is not generic, ```fmt::Display``` can be implemented.

```rust
use std::fmt; // Import `fmt`

// A structure holding two numbers. `Debug` will be derived so the results can
// be contrasted with `Display`.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MinMax(i64, i64);

// Implement `Display` for `MinMax`.
impl fmt::Display for MinMax {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Use `self.number` to refer to each positional data point.
        write!(f, "({}, {})", self.0, self.1)
    }
}

// Define a structure where the fields are nameable for comparison.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Point2D {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// Similarly, implement `Display` for `Point2D`
impl fmt::Display for Point2D {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Customize so only `x` and `y` are denoted.
        write!(f, "x: {}, y: {}", self.x, self.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let minmax = MinMax(0, 14);

    println!("Compare structures:");
    println!("Display: {}", minmax);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", minmax);

    let big_range =   MinMax(-300, 300);
    let small_range = MinMax(-3, 3);

    println!("The big range is {big} and the small is {small}",
             small = small_range,
             big = big_range);

    let point = Point2D { x: 3.3, y: 7.2 };

    println!("Compare points:");
    println!("Display: {}", point);
    println!("Debug: {:?}", point);

    // Error. Both `Debug` and `Display` were implemented, but `{:b}`
    // requires `fmt::Binary` to be implemented. This will not work.
    // println!("What does Point2D look like in binary: {:b}?", point);
}
```

So, ```fmt::Display``` has been implemented but ```fmt::Binary``` has not, and therefore cannot be used. ```std::fmt``` has many such ```traits``` and each requires its own implementation. This is detailed further in ```std::fmt```.

**Activity**

After checking the output of the above example, use the ```Point2D``` struct as a guide to add a ```Complex``` struct to the example. When printed in the same way, the output should be:

```shell
Display: 3.3 + 7.2i
Debug: Complex { real: 3.3, image: 7.2 }
```

**Testcase: List**

Implementing ```fmt::Display``` for a structure where the elements must each be handled sequentially is tricky. The problem is that each ```write!``` generates a ```fmt::Result```. Proper handling of this requires dealing with *all* the results. Rust provides the ```?``` operator for exactly this purpose.

Using ```?``` on ```write!``` looks like this:

```rust
// Try `write!` to see if it errors.
// If it errors, return the error. Otherwise continue
write!(f, "{}", value)?;
```

With ```?``` available, implementing ```fmt::Display``` for a ```Vec``` is straightforward:

```rust
use std::fmt; // Import the `fmt` module.

// Define a structure named `List` containing a `Vec`.
struct List(Vec<i32>);

impl fmt::Display for List {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        // Extract the value using tuple indexing,
        // and create a reference to `vec`.
        let vec = &self.0;

        write!(f, "[")?;

        // Iterate over `v` in `vec` while enumerating the iteration
        // count in `count`.
        for (count, v) in vec.iter().enumerate() {
            // For every element except the first, add a comma.
            // Use the ? operator to return on errors.
            if count != 0 { write!(f, ", ")?; }
            write!(f, "{}", v)?;
        }

        // Close the opened bracket and return a fmt::Result value.
        write!(f, "]");
    }
}

fn main() {
    let v = List(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    println!("{}", v);
}
```

**Activity**

Try changing the program so that the index of each element in the vector is also printed. The new output should look like this:

```rust
[0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 3]
```

#### ***1.2.3 - Formatting***

We've seen that formatting is specified via a *format string*:

* ```format!("{}", foo) -> "3735928559"```
* ```format!(0x{:X}, foo) -> "0xDEADBEEF"```
* ```format!(0o{:o}, foo) -> "0o33653337357"```

The same variable (```foo```) can be formatted differently depending on which *argument type* is used: ```x``` vs ```o``` vs ```unspecified```.

This formatting functionally is implemented via trails, and there is one trait for each argument type. The most common formatting trait is ```Display```, which handles cases where the argument type is left unspecified ```{}``` for instance.

```rust
use std::fmt::{self, Formatter, Display};

struct City {
    name: &'static str,
    // Latitude
    lat: f32,
    // Longitude
    lon: f32,
}

impl Display for City {
    // `f` is a buffer, and this method must write the formatted string into it
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        let lat_c = if self.lat >= 0.0 { 'N' } else { 'S' };
        let lon_c = if self.lon >= 0.0 { 'E' } else { 'W' };

        // `write!` is like `format!`, but it will write the formatted string
        // into a buffer (the first argument)
        write!(f, "{}: {:.3}°{} {:.3}°{}",
               self.name, self.lat.abs(), lat_c, self.lon.abs(), lon_c)
    }
}

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Color {
    red: u8,
    green: u8,
    blue: u8,
}

fn main() {
    for city in [
        City { name: "Dublin", lat: 53.347778, lon: -6.259722 },
        City { name: "Oslo", lat: 59.95, lon: 10.75 },
        City { name: "Vancouver", lat: 49.25, lon: -123.1 },
    ].iter() {
        println!("{}", *city);
    }
    for color in [
        Color { red: 128, green: 255, blue: 90 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 3, blue: 254 },
        Color { red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0 },
    ].iter() {
        // Switch this to use {} once you've added an implementation
        // for fmt::Display.
        println!("{:?}", *color);
    }
}
```

**Activity**

Add an implementation of the ```fmt::Display``` trait for the ```Color``` struct above so that the output displays as: 

```shell
RGB (128, 255, 90) 0x80FF5A
RGB (0, 3, 254) 0x0003FE
RGB (0, 0, 0) 0x000000
```

Reference [./src/demo03.rs](./src/demo03.rs)

## **2 - Primitives**

Rust provides access to a wide variety of ```primitives```. A sample includes:

**Scalar types**

* Signed integers: ```i8```, ```i16```, ```i32```, ```i64```, ```i128``` and ```isize``` (pointer size)
* Unsigned integer: ```u8```, ```u16```, ```u32```, ```u64```, ````u128```` and ```usize``` (pointer size)
* Floating point: ```f32```, ```f64```
* ```char``` Unicode scalar values like ```'a'```, ```'⍺'```, ```'∞'``` (4 bytes each)
* ```bool``` either ```true``` or ```false```
* and the unit type ```()```, whose only possible value is an empty tuple: ```()```

Despite the value of a unit type being a tuple, it is not considered a compound type because it does not contain multiple values.

**Compound Types**

* arrays like ```[1, 2, 3]```
* tuples like ```(1, true)```

Variables can always be *type annotated*. Numbers may additionally be annotated via a *suffix or by default*.

Integer default to ```i32``` and floats to ```f64```.

Note that Rust can also infer types from context.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Variables can be type annotated.
    let logical: bool = true;

    let a_float: f64 = 1.0;  // Regular annotation
    let an_integer   = 5i32; // Suffix annotation

    // Or a default will be used.
    let default_float   = 3.0; // `f64`
    let default_integer = 7;   // `i32`
    
    // A type can also be inferred from context 
    let mut inferred_type = 12; // Type i64 is inferred from another line
    inferred_type = 4294967296i64;
    
    // A mutable variable's value can be changed.
    let mut mutable = 12; // Mutable `i32`
    mutable = 21;
    
    // Error! The type of a variable can't be changed.
    mutable = true;
    
    // Variables can be overwritten with shadowing.
    let mutable = true;
}
```

Reference [./src/demo04.rs](./src/demo04.rs)

### ***2.1 - Literals and Operator***

Integer ```1```, floats ```1.2```, characters ```'a'```, string ```"abc"```, booleans ```true``` and the unit type ```()``` can be expressed using literals. 

Integers can, alternatively, be expressed hexadecimal, octal or binary notation using these prefixes respectively: ```0x```, ```0o``` or ```0b```.

Underscores can be inserted in numeric literals to improve readability, e.g. ```1_0000``` is the same as ```1000```, and ```0.000_001``` is the same as ```0.000001```.

We need to tell the compiler the type of the literals we use. For now, we'll use the ```u32``` suffix to indicate that the literal is an unsigned 32-bit integer, and the ```i32``` suffix to indicate that it's signed 32-bit integer.

The operators available and their precedence in Rust are similar to other C-like languages.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Integer addition
    println!("1 + 2 = {}", 1u32 + 2);

    // Integer subtraction
    println!("1 - 2 = {}", 1i32 - 2);
    // TODO ^ Try changing `1i32` to `1u32` to see why the type is important

    // Short-circuiting boolean logic
    println!("true AND false is {}", true && false);
    println!("true OR false is {}", true || false);
    println!("NOT true is {}", !true);

    // Bitwise operations
    println!("0011 AND 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 & 0b0101);
    println!("0011 OR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 | 0b0101);
    println!("0011 XOR 0101 is {:04b}", 0b0011u32 ^ 0b0101);
    println!("1 << 5 is {}", 1u32 << 5);
    println!("0x80 >> 2 is 0x{:x}", 0x80u32 >> 2);

    // Use underscores to improve readability!
    println!("One million is written as {}", 1_000_000u32);
}
```

Reference [./src/demo05.rs](./src/demo05.rs)

### ***2.2 - Tuples***

A tuple is a collection of values of different types. Tuples are constructed using parentheses ```()```, and each tuple itself is a value with type signature ```(T1, T2, ...)```, where ```T1```, ```T2``` are the types of its members. Functions can use tuples to return multiple values, as tuples can hold any number of values.

```rust
// Tuples can be used as function arguments and as return values
fn reverse(pair: (i32, bool)) -> (bool, i32) {
    // `let` can be used to bind the members of a tuple to variables
    let (int_param, bool_param) = pair;

    (bool_param, int_param)
}

// The following struct is for the activity.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Matrix(f32, f32, f32, f32);

fn main() {
    // A tuple with a bunch of different types
    let long_tuple = (1u8, 2u16, 3u32, 4u64,
                      -1i8, -2i16, -3i32, -4i64,
                      0.1f32, 0.2f64,
                      'a', true);

    // Values can be extracted from the tuple using tuple indexing
    println!("long tuple first value: {}", long_tuple.0);
    println!("long tuple second value: {}", long_tuple.1);

    // Tuples can be tuple members
    let tuple_of_tuples = ((1u8, 2u16, 2u32), (4u64, -1i8), -2i16);

    // Tuples are printable
    println!("tuple of tuples: {:?}", tuple_of_tuples);
    
    // But long Tuples (more than 12 elements) cannot be printed
    // let too_long_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13);
    // println!("too long tuple: {:?}", too_long_tuple);
    // TODO ^ Uncomment the above 2 lines to see the compiler error

    let pair = (1, true);
    println!("pair is {:?}", pair);

    println!("the reversed pair is {:?}", reverse(pair));

    // To create one element tuples, the comma is required to tell them apart
    // from a literal surrounded by parentheses
    println!("one element tuple: {:?}", (5u32,));
    println!("just an integer: {:?}", (5u32));

    //tuples can be destructured to create bindings
    let tuple = (1, "hello", 4.5, true);

    let (a, b, c, d) = tuple;
    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}, {:?}", a, b, c, d);

    let matrix = Matrix(1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2);
    println!("{:?}", matrix);

}
```

Reference [./src/demo06.rs](./src/demo06.rs)

**Activity**

1. *Recap*: Add the ```fmt::Display``` trait the ```Matrix``` struct in the above example, so that if you switch from printing the debug format ```{:?}``` to the display format ```{}```, you see the following output:

```shell
( 1.1, 1.2 )
( 2.1, 2.2 )
```

2. Add ```transpose``` function using the ```reverse``` function as a template, which accepts a matrix as an argument, and returns a matrix in which two elements have been swapped. For example:

```rust
println!("Matrix:\n{}", matrix);
println!("Transpose:\n{}", transpose(matrix));
```

results in the output: 

```shell
Matrix:
( 1.1, 1.2 )
( 2.1, 2.2 )
Transpose:
( 1.1, 2.1 )
( 1.2, 2.2 )
```

### ***2.3 - Arrays and Slices***

An array is a collection of objects of the same type ```T```, stored in contiguous memory. Arrays are created using brackets ```[]```, and their length. which is know at compile time, is part of their type signature ```[T; length]```.

Slices are similar to arrays, but their length is not known at compile time. Instead, a slice is a two-word object, the first word is a pointer to the data, and the second word is the length of the slice. The word size is the same as usize, determined by the processor architecture e.g. 65-bits on an x86-64. Slices can be used to borrow a section of an array, and have the type signature ```&[T]```.

```rust
use std::mem;

// This function borrows a slice
fn analyze_slice(slice: &[i32]) {
    println!("first element of the slice: {}", slice[0]);
    println!("the slice has {} elements", slice.len());
}

fn main() {
    // Fixed-size array (type signature is superfluous)
    let xs: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    // All elements can be initialized to the same value
    let ys: [i32; 500] = [0; 500];

    // Indexing starts at 0
    println!("first element of the array: {}", xs[0]);
    println!("second element of the array: {}", xs[1]);

    // `len` returns the count of elements in the array
    println!("number of elements in array: {}", xs.len());

    // Arrays are stack allocated

## **3 - Custom Types**

Rust custom data types are formed mainly through the two keywords: 

* ```struct```: define a structure
* ```enum```: define an enumeration

Constants can also be created via the ```const``` and ```static``` keywords.

### ***3.1 - Structures***

There are three types of structures ("structs") that can be created using the ```struct``` keyword:

* Tuple structs, which are, basically, named tuples. 
* The classic C-structs
* Unit structs, which are field-less, are useful for generics.

```rust
// An attribute to hide warnings for unused code.
#![allow(dead_code)]

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u8,
}

// A unit struct
struct Unit;

// A tuple struct
struct Pair(i32, f32);

// A struct with two fields
struct Point {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
}

// Structs can be reused as fields of another struct
struct Rectangle {
    // A rectangle can be specified by where the top left and bottom right
    // corners are in space.
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

fn main() {
    // Create struct with field init shorthand
    let name = String::from("Peter");
    let age = 27;
    let peter = Person { name, age };

    // Print debug struct
    println!("{:?}", peter);

    // Instantiate a `Point`
    let point: Point = Point { x: 10.3, y: 0.4 };

    // Access the fields of the point
    println!("point coordinates: ({}, {})", point.x, point.y);

    // Make a new point by using struct update syntax to use the fields of our
    // other one
    let bottom_right = Point { x: 5.2, ..point };

    // `bottom_right.y` will be the same as `point.y` because we used that field
    // from `point`
    println!("second point: ({}, {})", bottom_right.x, bottom_right.y);

    // Destructure the point using a `let` binding
    let Point { x: left_edge, y: top_edge } = point;

    let _rectangle = Rectangle {
        // struct instantiation is an expression too
        top_left: Point { x: left_edge, y: top_edge },
        bottom_right: bottom_right,
    };

    // Instantiate a unit struct
    let _unit = Unit;

    // Instantiate a tuple struct
    let pair = Pair(1, 0.1);

    // Access the fields of a tuple struct
    println!("pair contains {:?} and {:?}", pair.0, pair.1);

    // Destructure a tuple struct
    let Pair(integer, decimal) = pair;

    println!("pair contains {:?} and {:?}", integer, decimal);
}
```

**Activity**

1. Add a function ```rect_area``` which calculates the area of a ```Rectangle``` (try using nested destructing). 
2. Add a function ```square``` which takes a ```Point``` and a ```f32``` as arguments, and returns a ```Rectangle``` with its top left corner on the point, and a width and height corresponding to the ```f32```.
