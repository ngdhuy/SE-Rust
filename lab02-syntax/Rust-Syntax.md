# Rust syntax by Example

Rust is a modern system programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency. It accomplishes these goals by being memory safe without using garbage collection.

Rust by example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries. To get even more out of these example, don't forget to install Rust locally and checkout the official docs. Additionally for the curious, you can also checkout the source code for this lab from url [https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/index.html). 

Now is the list of examples:
